Using sites like these as my precedents, I wanted to create a similarly playful experience but with an underlying message; the importance of colour contrast in web accessibility.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also wanted to try my hand at building something a bit trickier using JavaScript than I had tried previously. My initial idea was to just create a website educating users about the issue, but this would have relied mostly on HTML and CSS. Building a game with multiple functions would be more challenging and rewarding.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAMobile} alt=\"Screenshots of the mobile view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Colour and contrast</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Web accessibility is a huge topic to tackle. It encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. I decided to concentrate on the visual issue of adequate colour contrast, which is vital to accessibility as all web users should be able to perceive content on the page.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> measure the difference in perceived \"luminance\" or brightness between two colors, and provide web content creators with a minimum contrast ratio for legible text. Accessibility is measured by two levels of conformance; AA (average) and AA (above average). To meet the minimum level AA, small text below 18pt must have a ratio of at least 4.5 to 1, and large text above 18pt must have a ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CADesktopImage} alt=\"Screenshot of the desktop view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The big idea</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I decided to design and build a quiz game application for fellow creatives to guess whether a particular colour combination’s contrast ratio is a pass or a fail. Pass/fail results of foreground text and background colours are easily accessed through the public WebAIM Color Contrast Checker API. This game has 10 combinations in total, which are loaded into the game via an external JSON file.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Users receive feedback after each combination on whether their guess was successful, and at the end of the quiz they receive their final score out of 10 along with a customised message. An integrated scoreboard and timer enhance the gamified experience, and social media sharing links at the end encourage users to spread awareness of the game and issue.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Testing the API</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">After outlining the concept, I began testing the functionality with a dummy question in order to get the API connected and functioning correctly. My test code below is asking the WebAIM API whether each colour combination passes or fails the accessibility test. The code is then checking the pass/fail result against the users yes/no guess, and either displaying a “Correct!” message or a “Wrong” message. In this test, the background and text colours are hard-coded into my JS file.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASuccessfulAPI} alt=\"Using developer tools to test the functionality\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The learning curve</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The next step was to compile multiple question variables - each with their own background and text colour properties - into an external JSON file. My initial plan was to load each question into a div in my HTML file, and use CSS to remove and display each div one by one. However, I had a lot of difficulty in getting the JS checking code to work for multiple questions.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CABrokenButtons} alt=\"Screenshot of the console log\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I did a lot of debugging and realised the code was displaying the correct message for questions 1 and 2, but advancing to question 3 only displayed the message from the previous question. The code for question 3 definitely worked as the console log showed that it had executed, but the message was being overwritten by question 2. I needed to find a way to execute the code one step at a time only.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>My 'Aha!' moment</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The biggest revelation I had during this project was my discovery of the 'unbind' method. The reason why my most recent code kept getting overwritten by previous functions was because I was attaching all my click events to the same two buttons. I had to unbind the click event from the Agree and Disagree button IDs after each loadQuestion() function had run, in order to start afresh each time.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAUnbind} alt=\"Screenshot of the unbind method in Sublime\" />\t  \t\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed the visual interface of my game using Figma, ensuring that the UI was colourful, engaging, and above all, accessible! Using Figma helped me to structure my CSS code quickly and easily, as it automatically provides you with CSS properties in the sidebar which you can quickly paste into your style sheet.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAFigma} alt=\"Artboards in Figma\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>To introduce the website I designed an introductory panel which explained what the game was about, and gave users a brief introduction to the colour contrast accessibility topic. At the end of the game I provided links for the user to learn more about the official web accessibility guidelines.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In order to increase the gamified aspect of the experience, I integrated a scoreboard and timer by utilising the 'setTimeout' method. This allowed me to display a Correct/Incorrect for a certain period of time, and then advance the user on to the next question.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASetTimeOut} alt=\"Screenshot of the setTimeout method in Sublime\" />\n\t\t    <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={CATabletVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of the game on tablet\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I also upped the game-like intensity by adding a timebar, which would start out as green at 0 seconds and then eventually switch to red as the time was approaching 5 seconds. I used the 'animate' method to increase the CSS width of the bar as time increased.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Finally, I added a customised sentiment message at the end of the quiz depending on the user's final score.

Not just the beverage (although I do drink it daily), but the entire culture. I love visiting cafés and trying different beans and roasts, and I’ve just recently got into concocting my own speciality brews at home. I even built a website just for fun explaining the ingredients in each drink, for those that don’t know their macchiato from their mocha.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARCoffeeBreakdownVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of my coffee breakdown site\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://madspesh.github.io/coffeebreakdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the live demo</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>So when we were given an open brief to design an AR experience for a brand and/or product of our choosing, I chose my current fave coffee brewer, the AeroPress. I spoke to a number of fellow coffee drinkers about how they made coffee at home, and discovered most used machines, instant coffee or paper filters. Very few used a coffee press, mostly due to not really knowing how it worked. This was a great opportunity to highlight an innovative product that people may not even know they want until they see it in action.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The product advantage</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">AeroPress is not a typical coffee press, but it uses a similar mechanism. Coffee is steeped for 10–50 seconds (depending on the grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The result is an espresso strength concentration of coffee, which can then be combined with other ingredients to make a variety of drinks.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand’s target audience are coffee aficionados; people who really know about coffee. As the equipment and process can appear to be quite confusing to those unfamiliar with the product, there is a barrier to entry. But also an area for opportunity! Aeropress is a brand which embraces creativity, as evidenced below in numerous posters for their <a href=\"https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World AeroPress Championships</a>. The essence of AeroPress embodies experimentation and innovation, therefore augmented reality could be their perfect tool for brand awareness.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPosters} alt=\"World AeroPress Championship posters\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Defining the challenge</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started out by doing some competitive research into similar brands. The AeroPress is a unique patented device, but there are some related products with similar niche audiences such as Chemex, Rok and Moka pot. There are also traditional French presses made by the likes of Bodum, Grosche and Espro. None of the competitors I researched had ever ventured into XR.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also did some first-hand behavioural research by documenting myself using the AeroPress, as I was initially thinking about designing an AR experience to explain how all the different equipment parts fit together and function. However, after having so much difficulty holding the phone whilst using the AeroPress, I realised that a handheld mobile guide (at least in the touch-powered sense) wouldn’t be helpful to new users at all.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARProcess} alt=\"Pictures of the AeroPress brewing process\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Visualising personas</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead of focusing on designing an AR experience solely for home use, I decided to approach the brief from a different angle and target coffee-drinkers in their native environment; the coffee shop. I continued my user research by visiting café’s and talking to the patrons around me as well as interviewing fellow students, and I began to identify some similar personality traits.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed two coffee-drinking personas that I wanted to target; the first being ‘The Café Hipster’. He lives in New York, is in his late 30’s, and works for a tech startup. He is a Café Hipster because he spends most of his spare time in independent coffee shops, and he turns his nose up at mainstream chains like Starbucks and mainstream products like Nespresso.</p>\t\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">He would like to make high-quality coffee at home, and he has heard of the AeroPress but doesn’t currently own one. He has a high level of tech proficiency due to his job, and tries to keep up with the latest products and trends. Augmented reality is something that he would be really interested in.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPersona1} alt=\"The ‘Café Hipster’ persona\" />    \n\t        <img src={ARPersona2} alt=\"The ‘Wannabe Barista’ persona\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <p>My second persona is ‘The Wannabe Barista’. She is a 19 year old student from Croydon, and like most people her age, she also has a high level of tech proficiency. However, she likes to spend her time online using social media platforms like Instagram.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">She prefers to visit mainstream chains like Starbucks, as she likes ordering fun seasonal drinks such as Pumpkin Spiced Latte. Her interest in social media also drives her to post pictures of the drinks she purchases, and she loves sharing cool new products and apps with friends. She doesn’t know how to make her own coffee at home, and she can’t afford an expensive machine like Nespresso.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARMarketingFunnel} alt=\"The two personas positioned in the marketing funnel\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Discovering opportunities</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">If we look at the traditional product marketing funnel above, The Wannabe Barista would be placed in the awareness bracket, as she has vaguely heard of AeroPress but does not yet have a strong interest in wanting to find out more. The Café Hipster is aware of and has an interest in AeroPress due to socialising with baristas in his favourite coffee shops, and wanting to keep up with hipster brands, but he needs an incentive to want to actually buy the product.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I brainstormed some potential marketing opportunities, focusing on the ways that I could capture my two persona’s in the Awareness and Interest phase. As both visited café’s often, this was a natural space to introduce them to the experience and make them aware of the AeroPress brand.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In terms of generating interest, I thought that showing the potential of the AeroPress, such as its ability to create popular coffee drinks such as Lattes and Cappuccinos, would be the best way to drive users to buy. I also thought about using moments of delight such as animations and visualisations to make my experience more fun and shareable.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARBrainstorm} alt=\"Post its from the brainstorming session\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The café space</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand space I chose to focus on was Stumptown Coffee Roasters. I chose Stumptown because they already have an affiliation with AeroPress. On their website, the brand has posted a <a href=\"https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how-to guide</a> showing users how to follow the ‘Stumptown style’ brew recipe they created specifically for AeroPress.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I visited both the Greenwich Village NYC location and the Midtown NYC location in the Ace Hotel. Although the flagship Greenwich Village branch sold AeroPress in-store, they did not serve AeroPress-made coffee. I had the idea that, perhaps by adding AeroPress coffee to their menu or creating a specific AeroPress menu, this might drive more sales. However, this would also need to be accompanied by some sort of in-store promotional experience.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I documented the experience of ordering coffee at Stumptown, in order to familiarise myself with the space and amenities available.I noticed that merchandising displays were placed strategically to entice people in the queue to order. The displays showcased Stumptown products such as branded mugs, cups and packages of coffee grounds.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStumptown} alt=\"Pictures from the Stumptown Greenwich Village location\" />  \n\t       \t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Concept statement</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My research into both AeroPress and Stumptown Coffee helped form the concept statement for the project.</p>\n\t\t        <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">An augmented reality experience with longevity; introduced in store, reactivated at home. A collaborative promotion between AeroPress and Stumptown, the experience is supported by a new in-store AeroPress menu and branded merchandise.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Many AR apps created by brands are used once, in the moment of discovery, and then never opened again. I wanted to create an experience that provided promotion for the brands involved, whilst still being useful enough for people to want to use it again at home. Outlining the product statement below helped me to envision what the final product would look like, and what features and technologies would need to be included.</p>\n\t        </div> \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARProductStatement} alt=\"The product statement overview\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Storyboarding the user journey</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I began to envision how the experience would unfold by sketching out the steps that my user persona would take. I made sure to include every scenario, starting from the moment they enter the store, all the way through to the point of purchase, and then finally imagining how the product would continue to be used at home.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStoryboard} alt=\"Storyboard sketches\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Low fidelity prototyping</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started to create some low fidelity mockups, using a paper prototype of the interface to test in the cafe. I realised that using an image marker flat to the table, such as a napkin, was not ideal as depending on the height of the chair/stool the user may be required to stand up to scan it. Also, a napkin is not very durable - I needed an image marker that will last a long time in order for the user to be able to reactivate the experience at home.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead, I decided to use the actual coffee cup to activate the AR experience, using Vuforia’s cylinder image target. For this proof of concept prototype I am just using a recyclable paper cup, but I imagine the real thing to be a ceramic reuseable mug. Forming the pattern for the cup’s design was challenging, as the image target needed to be unique and highly contrasted enough to be easily detected by the Vuforia Engine.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARLowFiPrototype} alt=\"Testing the low fidelity prototype in store\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Creating the AR experience in Unity</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">3D assets such as the translucent cup were designed and imported from Cinema 4D, but the animated drinks were created directly in Unity using Animator Controllers. I wrote scripts which would trigger the animations when tapping objects within the scene.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Within the screen, Unity UI was the main toolset I used to design the buttons and canvas layout of the user interface. Icons and graphics were created in Adobe Illustrator, exported as PNGs and imported into the project to be used in the ingredients and how-to overlay panels.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARUnityVideo} alt=\"Testing the experience in Unity\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Proof of concept</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final technical prototype can be categorised into three sections; firstly the main scene in which users can see the ingredients breakdown of different coffee drinks by tapping on the coasters, secondly the key screen panel which explains how each ingredient should be prepared, and lastly the full screen overlay which takes the user through the steps to creating the ‘Stumptown style’ AeroPress recipe.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The full screen overlay is the final stage of the experience; the reason for users to continue using the app once they’ve made their purchase and left the store. My prior research taught me that any digital devices used with AeroPress should ideally be hands free, so users can either tap through the steps or use voice commands to advance. I also integrated timer functions into a few of the steps to ensure that users are able to recreate the exact Stumptown brew.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARFeaturesVideo} alt=\"Screen recordings of the three main features\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The proof of concept prototype was deployed onto an iPhone and demonstrated during a class critique with creative technologists from Havas. I received good feedback about the project, some of the most notable being that the experience could be better realised within the browser as a WebAR application.

This book is for all theater artists—actors, writers, designers, and directors—who wish to create work that embraces the unbridled potential of the stage.</h5>\n            </div>             \n            <br />\n\t\t    </div>\n      \t</div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default BlogReferences;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20180827Slide from '../img/blog_20180827_slide.jpg';\nimport Blog20180827Sketch from '../img/blog_20180827_sketch.jpg';\nimport Blog20180827PaperPrototype from '../img/blog_20180827_paperprototype.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog2018082 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">First Paper Prototype</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        \t<h3>2019-08-27</h3>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This first week of class was spent clarifying the area I want to concentrate on for my thesis. For our getting-to-know-you <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19RViC9GsvPa6NRHOeDKfh08FWthqHF_mHQ_dQLFaL6Q/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">class presentation</a>, I created this slide illustrating a few of my interests.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Slide} alt=\"Slide showing my ideas for thesis\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m still not 100% sure about my direction, as there are a couple of other avenues which I would be interested in exploring. But for now, I am settling on glossophobia. Glossophobia is a type of speech anxiety, defined by a fear of public speaking. The term is derived from the Greek word glōssa, meaning tongue.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would describe myself as an introvert who likes being around people, but when it comes to work-related situations (interviews, presentations) or social environments where I feel pressured to speak, I clam up. This is something that has affected me for as long as I can remember. In these types of situations, I have a tendency to ‘go red’, my chest starts pounding, and sometimes I find it difficult to control my voice. Even just thinking about these encounters can trigger me.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Concentrating on glossophobia for my thesis could act as a form of therapy for me, as although I’ve looked into coping mechanisms in the past, I’ve never found something that actually works. I think this is an issue that a lot of my peers suffer with too, so there would be lots of opportunity for user research and testing.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">It’s also a subject which can be interpreted in a number of ways, whether it be a digital or physical coping mechanism, an art piece triggered by the issue, or even an immersive experience demonstrating how glossophobia feels.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m not sure which direction my project will take, but I have some initial ideas right now. I did some sketches illustrating a presentation device using augmented reality. The user can take advantage of two views; the front-facing ‘selfie’ mode and the rear camera mode.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using selfie mode, the user can review their speaker notes as well as the slides they need to present. The camera will analyse their facial movements and a microphone will record their voice. The user can receive feedback on the speed of their sentences, the number of times they say certain words (eg. ‘like’), how often they smiled, etc.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Sketch} alt=\"A sketch of my AR presentation software idea\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using the rear camera mode, users can treat the device like an AR teleprompter. The screen will display speaker notes karaoke-style, and augmented reality can be used to recreate a social scene for the user to practice in. I created the paper prototype below to show how the selfie mode might work on a tablet.</p>\n\t        </div>\t   \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827PaperPrototype} alt=\"A paper prototype of the selfie mode\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would like to get some feedback on whether this is an interesting route to continue with, and if so, what kind of features should or shouldn’t be included.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog2018082;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190904MindMap from '../img/blog_20190904_mindmap.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190904 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Mind Mapping + Goal Setting</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-04</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week in class, I made a mind map around my central theme of glossophobia. The first level associations are based on themes of professional environments (work, school, etc.), social environments (parties, weddings, etc.), mental states and physical states when experiencing the fear of public speaking.

If I don’t define my audience quickly, it will be difficult to start conducting interviews and ideating solutions to potential problems.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I need to create an interview guide with questions that I want to ask my defined user/audience sets.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I need to start listing the potential technologies that I might want to use, so that I can figure out which methods would be best suited for each problem I’m trying to solve.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <h2>What do I need to do next week?</h2>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will interview at least one person from one of my defined user/audience sets.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Based on feedback from this interview/s, I need to define at least one problem to address with a prototype.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will start sketching possible solutions to this problem, perhaps storyboarding an experience.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will pick which technology from my list is best suited to address this problem, and begin actually creating a higher definition or technical prototype.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <h2>What are my overall semester goals?</h2>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Throughout all of my classes, I will take notes on instructor and student presentations - observing their mannerisms, what they spoke about well, what received a good response from the audience, etc. This will help me to identify what makes a good public speaker.</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will improve my Unity skills and general knowledge of AR/VR</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will learn a 3D modelling program (probably Blender)</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will learn a digital data visualisation program (D3.js?)</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will become more familiar with a voice to text AI (IBM Watson?)</p>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I will visit the XReality Center, as I haven’t been yet <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"grimace\">😬</span></p>\n          </div>          \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’d like to try and check in with these goals on a weekly basis using this blog. If I don’t manage to accomplish everything I planned for that week, those goals will carry over to the next week. As for the overall semester goals, most of them (Unity, data visualisation and visiting the XReality Center) will be handled through my elective classes and assignments. I started an online intro class to Blender this Labor Day, so I’ll try and continue with that on the weekends. It would be good to try modeling something in 3D that is related to my project..

Glossophobia seems like quite a specific topic to focus on, but in reality there are many ways to illustrate the subject; from service orientated products to more abstract expressive forms. My first prototype was definitely more service oriented, and my background in UX/UI is pushing me towards a more user-focused, 'helpful' project. However, this is my thesis and I have the time to experiment and try out new things (like games).</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Storyboard} alt=\"My game storyboard\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\"> I've never made a 3D game before, so for my second prototype I'm experimenting with that format to see how I like the process and hear what other people think of this weird freaky eyeball game. The idea is that you are a character who has to give a speech in an auditorium, but in order to get there you have to take a winding, treacherous path. You have a full script to read at the beginning, but the longer it takes to get to the auditorium, the more difficult it is to read. By the time you get inside, you have lost all your words and have nothing to say. Above is a quick storyboard of how the game would progress.</p>   \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender1} alt=\"Creating a spiral shape in Blender\" />  \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender2} alt=\"Building the auditorium in Blender\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I used Blender to create the auditorium, and I set up the scene using Unity. I added a first person controller for the player to navigate the scene using their keyboard, but I'm thinking about other forms of controllers - maybe voice commands could be cool? Below is a screen recording of how it looks so far. I still need to add the interactivity - the heat/steam rising, the eyeballs turning to look at you, maybe some scary music. This is a work in progress.</p>\n\t        </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190910Unity} alt=\"A video recording of the game scene so far\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In other news, I'm happy that I managed to cross off one of my semester goals of visiting the XReality Lab (I will write more about this when I visit again). I also started to write down a list of my project's potential audience types, possible situations and environments where glossophobia could occur, the physical/mental symptoms of glossophobia, and viable technological solutions which could help ease or bring awareness to the issue. This list is really helpful when thinking about questions to ask during interviews, which will be the next part of my research phase.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Notes1} alt=\"Notes on audience/users and situations/environments\" /> \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Notes2} alt=\"Notes on physical/mental symptoms and technological solutions\" /> \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <h2>What do I need to do this week?</h2>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I need to interview at least one person from one of my defined user/audience sets.

I want to speak to past students who have done projects in the domain of public speaking, as well as people working in academia who are involved in speech and voice training. I actually found two professors within The New School, from Lang and the Mannes School of Music, so hopefully I'll be able to speak to them in person at some point. I also found some people working in XR for therapy, who would be able to give me some good tips on AR/VR techniques for anxiety.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\"> \n                I also got some advice about looking into other areas outside of public speaking such as HR and recruitment, and it got me thinking about a charity event that I used to volunteer at back in London called Crisis at Christmas. Every year around the holiday season, the Crisis centres hold a range of activities geared towards helping homeless people with shelter and comfort at Christmas. The first year I went I was an arts and crafts volunteer, but the second time I volunteered in the IT department which involved helping guests with writing resumes, sending emails, and other computer activities. Now that I'm thinking more about a specific audience, I'm wondering whether a product to help someone prepare for a job interview for example would be helpful. One thing I know is that it would need to be simple to use and relatively low tech, as the equipment at centres like this is usually very old.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">          \n                I got some good feedback from my presentation on Friday, and now I'm thinking about ways I can integrate the playful aspects of a game with a more serious method of treatment for public speaking anxiety. I went to the XReality Center at The New School last week, and this week I visited RLab in Brooklyn for my XR in the Real World class - it's given me lots of inspiration about things to experiment with. At the XReality Center I met Maya Georgieva (director of Digital Learning) and got the chance to try out the Magic Leap, which was amazing!</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190913MagicLeap} alt=\"Magic Leap equipment and glasses view of the Create UI\" /> \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The program I used was called Create - I've added a screenshot above of how the UI menu looked from inside the glasses. The Magic Leap detected the floor and walls of the center, and I was able to place blocks with gravity which toppled over if nudged. I could also place scenes, stickers and moving objects such as fish and dinosaurs. There was the option to build pipes and connecting objects; I didn’t try that enough though. I could draw around the room using various types of pens with different textures. The controller is a handheld laser pointer which I used to interact with the UI. There were three inputs - a main trigger button to control the laser, another button to bring up submenus and make other selections, and a small button on top to exit/cancel things. I could walk around the drawings I made, seeing them from the front, side and back view.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">I noticed that they had some VR programs available to try for the Oculus Gear/Go. One of them looked like it was a kind of interview prep program, so I definitely want to go back soon and check that out.  I know Samsung also have a suite of VR apps for Oculus that are geared towards public speaking, called <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/1096173157163965&ref=oculus_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#BeFearless</a>.

The concept for my AR feature is quite basic, but the technical side of it was more difficult to execute. It's still not fully working on my iPhone, but it seems to be useable on my laptop. I am testing the functionality of using my voice to control a text object in augmented reality. Sometimes the speech recogniser has trouble identifying my words. There also seems to be a bug which is causing the text to animate onto the screen twice. I’m wondering if other AI models might have better results with the speech recognition issue - I’d like to try Google Cloud Speech-to-Text next. Below is a summary of this third prototype.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190924PhoneScreenshot} alt=\"A screenshot of the prototype built to my iPhone\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What is it?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">A technical prototype to test audio commands on augmented reality objects.</p>   \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Why should people care?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Remembering what to say during important conversations, such as presentations and interviews, is a common pain point amongst people who suffer from anxiety about public speaking.</p>               \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What goals does this prototype serve?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Notify the user that an important topic has been mentioned</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Remind the user about related topics they need to talk about</p>\n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What should the audience know?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This is a feature that can be used before an event (eg. when practising a public speech), during an event (eg. whilst doing a phone interview), and after an event (eg. when reviewing a recording of your performance).</p>     \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What are the constraints and/or specifications?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This prototype uses IBM Watson for speech-to-text recognition and Vuforia for augmented reality, but any other AI/AR technologies will do.

As you can see below, the prototype identifies when certain keywords are spoken (ie. ‘animation’, ‘design’ and ‘illustration’), and brings up a text overlay with some bullet points about that keyword (eg. ‘animation’ brings up bullet points such as ‘storyboarding’ and ‘After Effects’). Ideally, the flow before this screen would ask the user to either upload a job description or manually enter certain keywords that they want to talk about. The user would then write some bullet points to riff upon when that keyword is mentioned (either by the users or a potential interviewer on the phone).</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190924VoiceExperiment} alt=\"A video recording of my technical prototype\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In additional to the prototype, I worked on creating <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1disKj1ETAeeBrUfqPk5BGRoDZ9TuNNqi1aYMC_UliCQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a list of 35 people I’d like to interview</a> based upon my community of practise that I identified last week.

Although he doesn’t have glossophobia, he gave me some interesting things to think about. He mentioned that, as an MBA student, talking to a lot of people isn’t a big deal for him; it’s smaller groups that scare him. He hates having to do small talk. Also, being an international student from India, he found networking events very difficult as he often didn’t have any context on topics that people often casually talk about (eg. TV shows like Seinfeld, ‘trendy’ areas in New York like Williamsburg). I found this interesting as I had always thought of good public speakers being confident in all areas of socialising. I’d like to continue talking to a range of people to get some more diverse insights on the subject.</p>\n          </div>                 \t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20190924;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190930CloudSpeechToText from '../img/blog_20190930_cloudspeechtotext.mp4';\nimport Blog20190930InterviewSynthesis from '../img/blog_20190930_interviewsynthesis.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930PostItSnapshot from '../img/blog_20190930_postitsnapshot.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930QuestionsMindMap from '../img/blog_20190930_questionsmindmap.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930TectonicLecture from '../img/blog_20190930_tectoniclecture.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190930 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Questions + Challenges</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-30</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">So there’s quite a lot to talk about in this blog! I continued on with my user interviews last week; so far, I’ve spoken to three people - one with a strong fear of public speaking, one with no fear whatsoever, and one who is on the fence (only fearful when she’s unprepared). The questions I’ve been asking are based on my interviewee’s personal opinions on the topic, the speaking they’ve done in their professional lives, and the speaking they’ve done in their personal lives. I’m currently trying to get all of my notes up onto the wall, grouping them based on these three areas.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930InterviewSynthesis} alt=\"Trying to synthesise my interview notes\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’d like to talk to a couple more people if possible before drawing any conclusions, but so far I have identified some similar themes:</p>    \n              <br />\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Physical responses to fear includes leg/hands shaking involuntarily, unconsciously touching the face/neck, heart racing, increased body heat - the typical symptoms you’d expect from anxiety</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Opinions on audience eye contact while speaking is mixed - some prefer no eye contact as it makes them more nervous, some feel that no eye contact means that their speech is boring</p>              \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- There is a common theme of ‘blacking-out’ - forgetting what you’re talking about mid-sentence and having to refer back to slides/notes or in worst cases fleeing the scene entirely</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Those comfortable with English preferred to look at certain keywords they had written down in their notes, while those who were less comfortable with English preferred to be able to see the full sentence/script of what they should say</p>    \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- All of the people I spoke to said they feel most confident and comfortable performing when they have practiced their speaking over and over again and know their subject matter very well</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Most of them had done some public speaking outside of work/school, ranging from anchoring an event to hosting a workshop with friends</p>    \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- None of them displayed any strong social anxiety at non work-related events such as parties, although they all said they disliked ‘small talk’ and found it difficult to come up with things to say</p>\n              <br />\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Once I’ve finished all of my user interviews, I’ll try to synthesise everything somehow and try to identify some key areas to address in my project.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930PostItSnapshot} alt=\"Learnings from one of my interviews\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week I also participated in an interesting workshop for my Cornell Tech Product Studio program. The <a href=\"https://www.tectonictheaterproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tectonic Theater Project</a> are a company based in New York who are known for their trademarked theater-making method, Moment Work™. Alongside developing new plays, the company works with educational institutions such as Cornell Tech to improve student's public speaking skills. We were given an engaging lecture by Scott Barrow, who explained how to make our ideas ‘leap forward’ when presenting an important pitch. He mentioned the importance of the presentation when selling an idea, noting that the ‘bowl’ is often more memorable than what’s in it (the content). He also talked about the common responses to public speaking - grouping them as ‘emotional, cerebral, physiological, and behavioral’ - which I thought was interesting.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930TectonicLecture} alt=\"Tectonic Theater Project lecture at Cornell Tech\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">After the lecture we broke into groups and practised 4 steps to communicating effectively: 1. Connecting with your audience (eye contact), 2. Using your body to communicate effectively and demonstrate ease (open arms, non-defensive body language), 3. Using your vocal presence to convey your message (speaking clearly, maybe using humour and humility), 4. Finishing strong (offering a conclusion). Grant Varjas was the faculty member that led the workshop for my group; I managed to speak to him after the class and mentioned my thesis project, so hopefully I’ll be able to talk to him at some point about the Tectonic Theater Project and public speaking.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As far as prototyping, I am continuing to experiment with different speech to text APIs to see which would be the most effective for my project. I had heard good things about Google Cloud Speech-To-Text so I created an account; it was definitely a lot more difficult to set up than IBM Watson, but that is probably due to me using node.js instead of Unity/C#. I managed to create a test app which allowed me to transcribe real-time voice streaming via Terminal.</p>\n          </div>    \n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190930CloudSpeechToText} alt=\"A video recording of my Google Cloud Speech to Text on Terminal\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m still working on how to use this real-time voice streaming in a web browser to control other Javascript functions. I’d like to create an AR prototype similar to my last one, but using WebXR technologies instead of Unity, so I’m curious to see if the two API’s will play well together. I found out that Javascript actually has a free built-in Web Speech API which can do basic speech recognition for voice commands, so depending on the form that my project takes, that might be all I need. But for more accurate voice transcription (and maybe extra features like translation/punctuation/grammar stuff), a paid API from Google Cloud, IBM Watson or Microsoft Azure would be necessary.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Finally, I have been reflecting this weekend on the areas that I’ve explored so far as far as research and prototyping. Starting to form my concept statement has helped me to narrow down the direction in which I want to go, but there are definitely a few holes in the plan which I need to fill before the end of the semester. I tried to identify my key domains in this mind map, and highlighted in red the things which I am most unsure about.</p>\n          </div>       \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930QuestionsMindMap} alt=\"Mind mapping my questions and challenges for my project\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My key challenge is probably going to be figuring out how to implement all the features that I want to include. I’m trying to get a head-start on the voice integration stuff, as I know that will be necessary for whatever my final product will be. I think that as long as I know exactly what technologies I want to use, I will be able to talk to my professors and get some tutoring over the next few months and learn how to fit everything together. I still don’t know how I’m going to integrate AR into my project though. Although I’m very interested in AR headsets like Magic Leap and Hololens, I really want whatever I make to be something that the everyday person can access without needing expensive technology. But I’m worried that AR might not be right for this project. I need to figure out quickly a useful way of implementing it, or just scrap the idea altogether.</p>\n          </div>  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As far as my weak spots, I know that I need to figure out a consistent schedule to balance my thesis work along with all my other classes. I need to ensure that I’m getting enough sleep and not working too late into the night which is a bad habit of mine. I also need to connect with other Design and Technology faculty and students who have experience in the areas that I need help with. As I was in Communication Design last year I really don’t know anybody from DT, so I’m going to have to try and reach out and get to know people more.</p>\n          </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20190930;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191006IncorrectBPM from '../img/blog_20191006_incorrectbpm.mp4';\nimport Blog20191006ARjsWebRecording from '../img/blog_20191006_arjswebrecording.mp4';\nimport Blog20191006PulseSensor from '../img/blog_20191006_pulsesensor.jpg';\nimport Blog20191006ARjsCode from '../img/blog_20191006_arjscode.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191006 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Fourth Technical Prototype</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-10-06</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last Thursday I had to present an idea in front of two crit judges for one of my class projects. Myself and my team had completely changed the theme/slides of our presentation 30 mins before, and as a result, I was VERY nervous. All I had to do was introduce our team and give a brief introduction to the idea, but my heart was pounding so fast that I could look down and see the fabric of my shirt quivering. I knew that the reason for these extreme nerves was my lack of preparation, but at that point what can you do! We obviously should’ve prepared more thoroughly, but it was too late for second chances.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">While my heart was thumping I started thinking about this thesis project for obvious reasons, and it actually eased the pounding a bit to concentrate on something different. I also tried breathing deeply, which is my usual go-to method. I think it helped a bit. But as soon as I started thinking about the presentation again the crazy thumping returned, and as our turn neared (unfortunately we were last to present) it was just out of control and felt ridiculous; I was convinced that as I approached the front everyone would notice my chest thumping and my body shaking. In that period of time before standing up to present, I really wished that I had something that could take the edge off somehow.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">On Saturday, I decided to begin making a prototype to test how someone might calm their nerves by visualising their heart rate decreasing. This is not a novel invention - many people have created digital products to help reduce anxiety such as Healium and Solace by Oscar de la Hera. However, I couldn’t find any augmented reality products which specifically target those glossophobia nerves that you tend to get right before a presentation. I think this prototype could possibly be developed further, and integrated into a preparatory public speaking ‘system’.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191006PulseSensor} alt=\"The Arduino pulse sensor\" />            \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What is it?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">A technical prototype to test connecting a physical pulse sensor with an augmented reality object. I am interested in whether being able to visualise your heart-rate reducing can in turn reduce anxiety.</p>   \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Why should people care?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Studies show that biofeedback, the idea of becoming more aware of your body's responses when you're stressed and anxious, can promote relaxation. Biofeedback types can include brain waves, sweat gland activity and heart-rate.</p>               \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What goals does this prototype serve?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Gives the user their heart-rate in beats per minute</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Allows the user to see that data visualised in augmented reality</p>\n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What should the audience know?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This is a feature that would be best used before a big event, such as a speech or job interview, to help ease the user’s nerves. As it can be accessed quickly through any web browser, it is perfect for last-minute stress relief.</p>     \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What are the constraints and/or specifications?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The prototype requires a marker to activate the AR experience. This is something that could perhaps be incorporated into a preparatory public speaking ‘kit’, containing physical items such as cue cards, stress balls, etc.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191006IncorrectBPM} alt=\"Showing the incorrect BPM reading from the Arduino pulse sensor\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As you can see above, the prototype uses an Arduino pulse sensor to detect my pulse in beats per minute (which is obviously very wrong - I’m still trying to configure this!) and sends the data to a local server using Johnny-Five, socket.io and express. I was then able to style the page (nothing crazy for now, just white text on a black background) using HTML/CSS. For the next part of this prototype idea, I incorporated AR.js into my HTML/CSS page. AR.js is an efficient and highly accessible solution that uses A-Frame to render augmented reality on the web. It runs 100% in your web browser with no separate app to install. You can’t do as much with it as you can with Unity/Vuforia, but I think it’s pretty cool that it works without having to download anything extra.</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191006ARjsWebRecording} alt=\"A video recording of the AR.js prototype\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I created a simple sphere shape with the beats per minute rate in the centre to show the basic mechanism of my idea. Ideally instead of a sphere, the 3D entity could be a beating heart or some other model that animates depending on the heart rate. Unfortunately, I still haven’t managed to connect the code from the Arduino to the AR.js model - the BPM rate is currently showing in the console but not rendering in the a-frame. Hopefully in time I’ll be able to figure out a solution. For now, I would like to share this concept with other people and see if this might be an interesting route to continue with.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191006ARjsCode} alt=\"The AR.js and Arduino code together, but not as one :(\" />  \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20191006;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191016Glitch from '../img/blog_20191016_glitch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016Tinkercad from '../img/blog_20191016_tinkercad.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016WebXR from '../img/blog_20191016_webxr.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016Meetup from '../img/blog_20191016_meetup.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191016 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Midterm Presentations + WebXR</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-10-16</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week I presented my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1msb9TBAYYvYoR1dxglIRhwKs8chpdWERV1MSPtvp2_I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">midterm thesis proposal</a> to two guest critiques, my professors, and my classmates. I feel that my research was thorough but the actual presentation could have gone better; I was nervous as always, and one of my prototypes failed to load (I think the GIF was too large) which was a big fail, as I would have liked to have gotten some more feedback on this particular direction. It just goes to show that you should always have a backup plan! (or a backup video). Below is my reflection on the feedback I received.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Prioritize - what is the most important item (or two items) of feedback?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The most important critique I got was to reexamine my audience and try to zero in on specific user needs, rather than generalising and trying to cater to everybody. By identifying a variety of precise use cases and designing something explicitly for them, I might find that this very specific problem could actually prove to be helpful to a broader audience.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The other important piece of feedback I received was to think about areas that are completely unrelated (and possibly the complete opposite) to what I envision my project to be. Right now I am pretty firm on XR most likely being my final form, but by trying other things maybe I’ll discover something unique, rather than building upon AR/VR things that people have already tried. One very different point of comparison could be looking into physical training, done by athletes, dancers and musicians - could their methods of focusing/concentrating on their goals be applied to public speaking in some way?</p>\n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Compare to feedback from earlier in the semester - are there patterns that emerge?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My guest critique Barbara Morris commented on bringing a humorous element into my project. I received a similar piece of feedback earlier in the semester, and although I did initially try the game prototype, this funny and playful element is obviously still missing from my current work.</p>               \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Do you have any follow-up questions? How do you plan to respond to the feedback?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would really like to have gotten some feedback on the ‘AI’ prototype that I created. As the GIF wasn’t working during the presentation, I might try to share my blog post about this prototype with my guest critiques, to see what they think of this approach vs. the heart rate sensor one that they saw.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’d also like to try and meet with Justin Bakse regarding some of the precedents that he mentioned I look into (specifically papers on the Apple earpods). I’m planning to get in contact with someone from the undergrad’s Game Club, to see if they have a Nintendo Switch that I can play with (I’d like to try out the 1-2 Switch game that Justin mentioned).</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Meetup} alt=\"The WebXR Meetup at RLab\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Now that midterms are over, I’m concentrating on reaching out to people in my community of practice. I’ve emailed a number of experts in the field of psychology, computer science, theater and voice training, so hopefully I’ll be able to arrange some in-person and over-the-phone interviews during the next few weeks. I also attended a WebXR Meetup on Tuesday evening at the RLab in Brooklyn which was very insightful. I chatted with a number of developers, designers and students from various companies and schools (I was the only person from Parsons there), and I’d definitely like to keep in contact with the people I spoke to.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Tinkercad} alt=\"Building a simple glTF model in Tinkercad\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">During the event we learnt about the possibilities of WebXR, and it’s accessibility advantages over traditional VR headsets due to being able to work within the web browser. I learned that although the technology is still evolving all the time, WebXR is currently very close to becoming stabilised, so it's definitely something that developers should consider switching to (particularly those coming from a WebGL background). I also found out that the API supports 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) and works with frameworks such as three.js, A-Frame, Babyon.js and React.js.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Glitch} alt=\"Coding in Glitch\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final part of the meetup was a quick ‘code-along’ tutorial to making a simple WebXR scene using A-Frame, Tinkercad and Glitch. I was amazed at how fast and easy it was to get a glTF model uploaded and working in 3D in the browser - the whole tutorial including modelling took less than 20 minutes! Above is the code we tweaked in Glitch, and below is how the scene renders in WebXR. Although I’ve kind of been ‘against’ VR up until this point due to there being so many VR public speaking tools out there already, it’s definitely a form that I’d like to play with a bit. One of the critiques that I received from Justin Bakse was that low-budget VR headsets like Google Cardboard are actually cheaper than smartphones.
