people who have a list of tasks to do, and just need some quiet time in order to get everything done. It's ideal for social working environments such as open-plan offices, where employees are likely to get easily distracted by coworkers.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The system is composed of two elements; a task management website and a modern desk light. The website has a to-do list of tasks which users can add to, cross off and delete. As their to-do list shrinks, the desk light gradually changes from red (do not disturb) to green (happy to chat).

Using sites like these as my precedents, I wanted to create a similarly playful experience but with an underlying message; the importance of colour contrast in web accessibility.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also wanted to try my hand at building something a bit trickier using JavaScript than I had tried previously. My initial idea was to just create a website educating users about the issue, but this would have relied mostly on HTML and CSS. Building a game with multiple functions would be more challenging and rewarding.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAMobile} alt=\"Screenshots of the mobile view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Colour and contrast</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Web accessibility is a huge topic to tackle. It encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. I decided to concentrate on the visual issue of adequate colour contrast, which is vital to accessibility as all web users should be able to perceive content on the page.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> measure the difference in perceived \"luminance\" or brightness between two colors, and provide web content creators with a minimum contrast ratio for legible text. Accessibility is measured by two levels of conformance; AA (average) and AA (above average). To meet the minimum level AA, small text below 18pt must have a ratio of at least 4.5 to 1, and large text above 18pt must have a ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CADesktopImage} alt=\"Screenshot of the desktop view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The big idea</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I decided to design and build a quiz game application for fellow creatives to guess whether a particular colour combination’s contrast ratio is a pass or a fail. Pass/fail results of foreground text and background colours are easily accessed through the public WebAIM Color Contrast Checker API. This game has 10 combinations in total, which are loaded into the game via an external JSON file.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Users receive feedback after each combination on whether their guess was successful, and at the end of the quiz they receive their final score out of 10 along with a customised message. An integrated scoreboard and timer enhance the gamified experience, and social media sharing links at the end encourage users to spread awareness of the game and issue.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Testing the API</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">After outlining the concept, I began testing the functionality with a dummy question in order to get the API connected and functioning correctly. My test code below is asking the WebAIM API whether each colour combination passes or fails the accessibility test. The code is then checking the pass/fail result against the users yes/no guess, and either displaying a “Correct!” message or a “Wrong” message. In this test, the background and text colours are hard-coded into my JS file.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASuccessfulAPI} alt=\"Using developer tools to test the functionality\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The learning curve</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The next step was to compile multiple question variables - each with their own background and text colour properties - into an external JSON file. My initial plan was to load each question into a div in my HTML file, and use CSS to remove and display each div one by one. However, I had a lot of difficulty in getting the JS checking code to work for multiple questions.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CABrokenButtons} alt=\"Screenshot of the console log\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I did a lot of debugging and realised the code was displaying the correct message for questions 1 and 2, but advancing to question 3 only displayed the message from the previous question. The code for question 3 definitely worked as the console log showed that it had executed, but the message was being overwritten by question 2. I needed to find a way to execute the code one step at a time only.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>My 'Aha!' moment</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The biggest revelation I had during this project was my discovery of the 'unbind' method. The reason why my most recent code kept getting overwritten by previous functions was because I was attaching all my click events to the same two buttons. I had to unbind the click event from the Agree and Disagree button IDs after each loadQuestion() function had run, in order to start afresh each time.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAUnbind} alt=\"Screenshot of the unbind method in Sublime\" />\t  \t\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed the visual interface of my game using Figma, ensuring that the UI was colourful, engaging, and above all, accessible! Using Figma helped me to structure my CSS code quickly and easily, as it automatically provides you with CSS properties in the sidebar which you can quickly paste into your style sheet.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAFigma} alt=\"Artboards in Figma\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>To introduce the website I designed an introductory panel which explained what the game was about, and gave users a brief introduction to the colour contrast accessibility topic. At the end of the game I provided links for the user to learn more about the official web accessibility guidelines.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In order to increase the gamified aspect of the experience, I integrated a scoreboard and timer by utilising the 'setTimeout' method. This allowed me to display a Correct/Incorrect for a certain period of time, and then advance the user on to the next question.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASetTimeOut} alt=\"Screenshot of the setTimeout method in Sublime\" />\n\t\t    <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={CATabletVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of the game on tablet\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I also upped the game-like intensity by adding a timebar, which would start out as green at 0 seconds and then eventually switch to red as the time was approaching 5 seconds. I used the 'animate' method to increase the CSS width of the bar as time increased.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Finally, I added a customised sentiment message at the end of the quiz depending on the user's final score. Users that scored 10 out of 10 would receive a 'perfect score!' message, whilst users that scored less than 1 received a 'did you even try?!' message.</p>\t\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASentimentMessage} alt=\"Screenshot of the sentiment if/else statements in Sublime\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My next steps are to sort out a bug I'm having with the 'replay' button at the end of the quiz, and to add in the Twitter 'retweet' functionality in order to spread awareness of the game. I would also like to integrate some more animation and perhaps illustrations into the game, in order to make the experience more fun and enjoyable. I think the customised message at the end could perhaps include some sort of fireworks animation if the user scores 10 out of 10.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://github.com/madspesh/WebAdvanced_Spring2019_gillr456/tree/master/Finals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View on GitHub</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n      \t</div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default CAProjectPage;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ARPhoneVideo from '../img/aeropress_phonevideo.mp4';\nimport ARCoffeeBreakdownVideo from '../img/aeropress_coffeebreakdownvideo.mp4';\nimport ARPosters from '../img/aeropress_posters.jpg';\nimport ARProcess from '../img/aeropress_process.gif';\nimport ARPersona1 from '../img/aeropress_persona1.png';\nimport ARPersona2 from '../img/aeropress_persona2.png';\nimport ARMarketingFunnel from '../img/aeropress_marketingfunnel.jpg';\nimport ARBrainstorm from '../img/aeropress_brainstorm.jpg';\nimport ARStumptown from '../img/aeropress_stumptown.jpg';\nimport ARProductStatement from '../img/aeropress_productstatement.jpg';\nimport ARStoryboard from '../img/aeropress_storyboard.jpg';\nimport ARLowFiPrototype from '../img/aeropress_lowfiprototype.jpg';\nimport ARUnityVideo from '../img/aeropress_unityvideo.mp4';\nimport ARFeaturesVideo from '../img/aeropress_featuresvideo.mp4';\nimport ARHowToGuide from '../img/aeropress_howtoguide.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass ARProjectPage extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n      \t<div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">An Augmented Reality Experience for AeroPress</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n        \t<div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<div className=\"padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t        <h1 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How might we use AR to introduce AeroPress to new audiences within the café space?</h1>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t    <div className=\"padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t        <div className=\"project-caption padding-top-1em\">\n\t\t\t\t        <h3>Context</h3>\n\t\t\t\t        <h5 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Proof of concept prototype for a collaborative AR brand experience, designed and developed in 2019 during the Design and Technology: Augmented Realities program at Parsons.</h5>\n\t\t\t        </div>\n\t\t\t        <div className=\"project-caption padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t\t        <h3>Role</h3>\n\t\t\t\t        <h5 className=\"padding-top-1em\">UX research, UI design and development.

Not just the beverage (although I do drink it daily), but the entire culture. I love visiting cafés and trying different beans and roasts, and I’ve just recently got into concocting my own speciality brews at home. I even built a website just for fun explaining the ingredients in each drink, for those that don’t know their macchiato from their mocha.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARCoffeeBreakdownVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of my coffee breakdown site\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://madspesh.github.io/coffeebreakdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the live demo</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>So when we were given an open brief to design an AR experience for a brand and/or product of our choosing, I chose my current fave coffee brewer, the AeroPress. I spoke to a number of fellow coffee drinkers about how they made coffee at home, and discovered most used machines, instant coffee or paper filters. Very few used a coffee press, mostly due to not really knowing how it worked. This was a great opportunity to highlight an innovative product that people may not even know they want until they see it in action.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The product advantage</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">AeroPress is not a typical coffee press, but it uses a similar mechanism. Coffee is steeped for 10–50 seconds (depending on the grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The result is an espresso strength concentration of coffee, which can then be combined with other ingredients to make a variety of drinks.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand’s target audience are coffee aficionados; people who really know about coffee. As the equipment and process can appear to be quite confusing to those unfamiliar with the product, there is a barrier to entry. But also an area for opportunity! Aeropress is a brand which embraces creativity, as evidenced below in numerous posters for their <a href=\"https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World AeroPress Championships</a>. The essence of AeroPress embodies experimentation and innovation, therefore augmented reality could be their perfect tool for brand awareness.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPosters} alt=\"World AeroPress Championship posters\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Defining the challenge</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started out by doing some competitive research into similar brands. The AeroPress is a unique patented device, but there are some related products with similar niche audiences such as Chemex, Rok and Moka pot. There are also traditional French presses made by the likes of Bodum, Grosche and Espro. None of the competitors I researched had ever ventured into XR.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also did some first-hand behavioural research by documenting myself using the AeroPress, as I was initially thinking about designing an AR experience to explain how all the different equipment parts fit together and function. However, after having so much difficulty holding the phone whilst using the AeroPress, I realised that a handheld mobile guide (at least in the touch-powered sense) wouldn’t be helpful to new users at all.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARProcess} alt=\"Pictures of the AeroPress brewing process\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Visualising personas</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead of focusing on designing an AR experience solely for home use, I decided to approach the brief from a different angle and target coffee-drinkers in their native environment; the coffee shop. I continued my user research by visiting café’s and talking to the patrons around me as well as interviewing fellow students, and I began to identify some similar personality traits.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed two coffee-drinking personas that I wanted to target; the first being ‘The Café Hipster’. He lives in New York, is in his late 30’s, and works for a tech startup. He is a Café Hipster because he spends most of his spare time in independent coffee shops, and he turns his nose up at mainstream chains like Starbucks and mainstream products like Nespresso.</p>\t\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">He would like to make high-quality coffee at home, and he has heard of the AeroPress but doesn’t currently own one. He has a high level of tech proficiency due to his job, and tries to keep up with the latest products and trends. Augmented reality is something that he would be really interested in.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPersona1} alt=\"The ‘Café Hipster’ persona\" />    \n\t        <img src={ARPersona2} alt=\"The ‘Wannabe Barista’ persona\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <p>My second persona is ‘The Wannabe Barista’. She is a 19 year old student from Croydon, and like most people her age, she also has a high level of tech proficiency. However, she likes to spend her time online using social media platforms like Instagram.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">She prefers to visit mainstream chains like Starbucks, as she likes ordering fun seasonal drinks such as Pumpkin Spiced Latte. Her interest in social media also drives her to post pictures of the drinks she purchases, and she loves sharing cool new products and apps with friends. She doesn’t know how to make her own coffee at home, and she can’t afford an expensive machine like Nespresso.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARMarketingFunnel} alt=\"The two personas positioned in the marketing funnel\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Discovering opportunities</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">If we look at the traditional product marketing funnel above, The Wannabe Barista would be placed in the awareness bracket, as she has vaguely heard of AeroPress but does not yet have a strong interest in wanting to find out more. The Café Hipster is aware of and has an interest in AeroPress due to socialising with baristas in his favourite coffee shops, and wanting to keep up with hipster brands, but he needs an incentive to want to actually buy the product.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I brainstormed some potential marketing opportunities, focusing on the ways that I could capture my two persona’s in the Awareness and Interest phase. As both visited café’s often, this was a natural space to introduce them to the experience and make them aware of the AeroPress brand.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In terms of generating interest, I thought that showing the potential of the AeroPress, such as its ability to create popular coffee drinks such as Lattes and Cappuccinos, would be the best way to drive users to buy. I also thought about using moments of delight such as animations and visualisations to make my experience more fun and shareable.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARBrainstorm} alt=\"Post its from the brainstorming session\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The café space</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand space I chose to focus on was Stumptown Coffee Roasters. I chose Stumptown because they already have an affiliation with AeroPress. On their website, the brand has posted a <a href=\"https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how-to guide</a> showing users how to follow the ‘Stumptown style’ brew recipe they created specifically for AeroPress.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I visited both the Greenwich Village NYC location and the Midtown NYC location in the Ace Hotel. Although the flagship Greenwich Village branch sold AeroPress in-store, they did not serve AeroPress-made coffee. I had the idea that, perhaps by adding AeroPress coffee to their menu or creating a specific AeroPress menu, this might drive more sales. However, this would also need to be accompanied by some sort of in-store promotional experience.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I documented the experience of ordering coffee at Stumptown, in order to familiarise myself with the space and amenities available.I noticed that merchandising displays were placed strategically to entice people in the queue to order. The displays showcased Stumptown products such as branded mugs, cups and packages of coffee grounds.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStumptown} alt=\"Pictures from the Stumptown Greenwich Village location\" />  \n\t       \t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Concept statement</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My research into both AeroPress and Stumptown Coffee helped form the concept statement for the project.</p>\n\t\t        <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">An augmented reality experience with longevity; introduced in store, reactivated at home. A collaborative promotion between AeroPress and Stumptown, the experience is supported by a new in-store AeroPress menu and branded merchandise.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Many AR apps created by brands are used once, in the moment of discovery, and then never opened again. I wanted to create an experience that provided promotion for the brands involved, whilst still being useful enough for people to want to use it again at home. Outlining the product statement below helped me to envision what the final product would look like, and what features and technologies would need to be included.</p>\n\t        </div> \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARProductStatement} alt=\"The product statement overview\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Storyboarding the user journey</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I began to envision how the experience would unfold by sketching out the steps that my user persona would take. I made sure to include every scenario, starting from the moment they enter the store, all the way through to the point of purchase, and then finally imagining how the product would continue to be used at home.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStoryboard} alt=\"Storyboard sketches\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Low fidelity prototyping</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started to create some low fidelity mockups, using a paper prototype of the interface to test in the cafe. I realised that using an image marker flat to the table, such as a napkin, was not ideal as depending on the height of the chair/stool the user may be required to stand up to scan it. Also, a napkin is not very durable - I needed an image marker that will last a long time in order for the user to be able to reactivate the experience at home.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead, I decided to use the actual coffee cup to activate the AR experience, using Vuforia’s cylinder image target. For this proof of concept prototype I am just using a recyclable paper cup, but I imagine the real thing to be a ceramic reuseable mug. Forming the pattern for the cup’s design was challenging, as the image target needed to be unique and highly contrasted enough to be easily detected by the Vuforia Engine.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARLowFiPrototype} alt=\"Testing the low fidelity prototype in store\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Creating the AR experience in Unity</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">3D assets such as the translucent cup were designed and imported from Blender, but the animated drinks were created directly in Unity using Animator Controllers. I wrote scripts which would trigger the animations when tapping objects within the scene.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Within the screen, Unity UI was the main toolset I used to design the buttons and canvas layout of the user interface. Icons and graphics were created in Adobe Illustrator, exported as PNGs and imported into the project to be used in the ingredients and how-to overlay panels.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARUnityVideo} alt=\"Testing the experience in Unity\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Proof of concept</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final technical prototype can be categorised into three sections; firstly the main scene in which users can see the ingredients breakdown of different coffee drinks by tapping on the coasters, secondly the key screen panel which explains how each ingredient should be prepared, and lastly the full screen overlay which takes the user through the steps to creating the ‘Stumptown style’ AeroPress recipe.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The full screen overlay is the final stage of the experience; the reason for users to continue using the app once they’ve made their purchase and left the store. My prior research taught me that any digital devices used with AeroPress should ideally be hands free, so users can either tap through the steps or use voice commands to advance. I also integrated timer functions into a few of the steps to ensure that users are able to recreate the exact Stumptown brew.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARFeaturesVideo} alt=\"Screen recordings of the three main features\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The proof of concept prototype was deployed onto an iPhone and demonstrated during a class critique with creative technologists from Havas. I received good feedback about the project, some of the most notable being that the experience could be better realised within the browser as a WebAR application.

Embedded into editorial articles from publishers such as TIME, Vice and The Guardian, the product enables users to take action on stories they’ve just read about by volunteering, signing petitions, donating money or contacting elected officials in support of their causes.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Action Button works with non-profits such as Amnesty International, Save The Children and Direct Relief, as well as socially conscious brands like Tommy Hilfiger, S’Well and NBC Universal to boost digital campaigns and spread awareness of important issues worldwide.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={SQSecondaryActions} alt=\"Volunteering and Petition actions I'd previously redesigned\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The power of touch</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Depending on the nature of the article, Action Button uses various ‘primary’ actions to initially engage users and guide them into taking action. These actions usually include quizzes, surveys and polls about the subject at hand, and they tend to produce high engagement due to their interactive affordances.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">One of the most popular actions is the sentiment poll, which allows users to express how they feel about a particular issue by dragging a slider button to the left or right of an x-axis. The interaction is particularly popular on mobile, and we wondered whether this method of playful touch could be employed in other areas.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Low to high fidelity</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The design process began with initial sketches, thinking of ways to merge the educational aspect of our quiz actions with the interactivity of our popular sentiment polls. I thought about using a circular rather than a horizontal slider to enable a different kind of sliding interaction. The text on the left hand side would respond to the user’s input; first asking them a question, then informing them of the answer. The text in the centre of the slider would highlight the user’s selection.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={SQPrimaryActions} alt=\"...\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>Using Sketch, I mocked up a few versions of this circular slider idea and shared the designs with the team. These initial options included UI elements such as pivot lines and arrows showing the direction in which users should slide. After user testing, I received some feedback about the confusing start position of the slider and the redundancy of the arrows, so I played with the rotation a bit and came up with a final ’horseshoe’-like design.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={SQSketch} alt=\"Various design mockups in Sketch\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Prototyping interactions</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Once the static visuals had been approved, I began creating animated prototypes in After Effects to demonstrate how the interactions would work. Although seemingly quite simplistic, the results animation took quite a few iterations to get right. Fading the Action Button icon into a pink tick icon for correct answers was fairly straightforward, but incorrect or ‘close' answers involved a layering transition in which the blue cross icon would move from the background to the foreground.</p>        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"padding-top-3em\" style={{paddingLeft: 2.5 + \"em\", paddingRight: 2.5 + \"em\"}}>\n\t        \t<img className=\"project-text-half\" style={{padding: 0}} src={SQCloseGuess} alt=\"Animated prototype of a close guess, created in After Effects\" />\n\t        \t<img className=\"project-text-half\" style={{padding: 0}} src={SQSmallIncorrectGuess} alt=\"Animated prototype of a smaller incorrect guess, created in After Effects\" />\n\t        \t<img className=\"project-text-half\" style={{padding: 0}} src={SQLargeIncorrectGuess} alt=\"Animated prototype of a larger incorrect guess, created in After Effects\" />\n\t        \t<img className=\"project-text-half\" style={{padding: 0}} src={SQCorrectGuess} alt=\"Animated prototype of a correct guess, created in After Effects\" />\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I worked directly alongside the software engineering team who did a great job in ensuring the visuals and interactions matched the initial designs as closely as possible. We collaborated together on adapting colour schemes for brand sponsored as well as Action Button themed content.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Mobile-friendly</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">One of the main issues with the sentiment poll interaction is its lack of screen real-estate on smaller devices. The full-width horizontal design is easily scaleable for mobile, but the smaller slider makes it less impactful to scroll from one edge to another.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The circular design of the slider quiz allows the layout to stack rather than shrink to fit smaller screens, and also supports longer titles and more textual information about the issue or cause, which was a big plus for our clients.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <video className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={SQMobile} alt=\"Mobile screen recording of the interaction\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Impactful results</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final iteration is now live and implemented in a number of Action Button campaigns, educating readers on social issues such as gun control, immigration and global warming. The new design delivered a boost of 5%+ engagement in just its first week of launch, and is now one of Action Button’s most popular interactions.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://embed.actionbutton.co/iframely/index?widgetId=SPK-QkFARA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Try it now</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n      \t</div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default SQProjectPage;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport HRTopView from '../img/houserules_topview.jpg';\nimport HRInterview from '../img/houserules_interview.jpg';\nimport HRInterviewMap from '../img/houserules_interviewmap.jpg';\nimport HRPainsGainsMap from '../img/houserules_painsgainsmap.png';\nimport HRSketchSessions from '../img/houserules_sketchsessions.jpg';\nimport HRPolarisingPrototypes from '../img/houserules_polarisingprototypes.jpg';\nimport HRKeynote from '../img/houserules_keynote.jpg';\nimport HRLowFidelityNotes from '../img/houserules_lowfidelitynotes.jpg';\nimport HRMidFidelityNotes from '../img/houserules_midfidelitynotes.jpg';\nimport HRPaperPrototypes from '../img/houserules_paperprototypes.jpg';\nimport HRLinearFlow from '../img/houserules_linearflow.jpg';\nimport HRSystemDiagram from '../img/houserules_systemdiagram.jpg';\nimport HRStyleTiles from '../img/houserules_styletiles.gif';\nimport HRBranding from '../img/houserules_branding.jpg';\nimport HRApprovingRulesInteraction from '../img/houserules_approvingrules.mp4';\nimport HRSuggestingTasksInteraction from '../img/houserules_suggestingtasks.mp4';\nimport HRReviewingPlansInteraction from '../img/houserules_reviewingplans.mp4';\nimport HRApprovingRulesFlow from '../img/houserules_approvingrules.png';\nimport HRSuggestingTasksFlow from '../img/houserules_suggestingtasks.png';\nimport HRReviewingPlansFlow from '../img/houserules_reviewingplans.png';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass HRProjectPage extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n      \t<div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">A Productivity App for Shared Households</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t    \t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <h1 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How might we help roommates work together to plan their day to day communal living?</h1>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <div className=\"project-caption-half padding-top-1em\">\n\t\t\t        <h3>Context</h3>\n\t\t\t        <h5 className=\"padding-top-1em\">House Rules is a communal home management system which helps roommates work together to plan their day-to-day living.

However in this day and age, particularly for those living in large metropolitan cities, cohabiting with roommates has almost become the norm. A recent study reported that around 40 percent of renters in New York are living in what Zillow calls “doubled up households”, where at least two working-age, unmarried or un-partnered adults are residing harmoniously (or inharmoniously) together.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Communal living can be tough, especially when the roommates in question aren’t already familiar with each other’s habits and quirks. A lack of communication about household issues can lead to quiet resentment, or even full-blown meltdowns. As a Communication Design student, I wondered whether there might be a way to improve roommate relationships and help make the house feel a little more like a home.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Understanding cohabitation</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In order to come up with a useful solution, I first needed to fully understand the problem. Initial desk research into primary and analogous domains revealed that, whilst there were many apps and websites dedicated to helping people find a roommate, there were very few that offered people support past the moving-in stage. The lack of competitors in the market spurred on my investigation, and I decided to focus on qualitative research in order to discover the ‘why’ behind people’s actions.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Interviewing potential users who were currently living or had previously lived with roommates would help me dig deeper into people's behaviour and aspirations. To help steer conversations in the right direction, I wrote an interview guide with open-ended questions about user's living environments, their social needs, and their relationship with their roommates. I spoke to 7 users in total; 4 students and 3 working professionals between the ages of 25 to 55, from various cities and cultural backgrounds.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRInterview} alt=\"Interviewing a potential user about their roommate experiences\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Identifying actionable insights</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The next step was to synthesise and make sense of everything I’d heard during the interview process. I found it easiest to listen back to my voice notes and write down important quotes on various post-its, which I later reorganised on the wall. I sorted everything into 12 chronological stages, beginning with finding the perfect roommate and ending with the final moving-out phase.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Below are a few soundbites from the interviews I conducted. I was able to talk to 2 of my users in their own homes with their roommates present, which allowed me to contextually observe their living situations first hand. However, people tended to be less candid speaking whilst their roommates were present, and I learned the most about my user’s specific pain points when interviewing outside of the home.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <br />\t\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-2em\">“Suggesting house rules halfway through wasn’t smart - we should have established them from the start.”</h4>\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Lucie, student, 3 roommates</h3>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-2em\">“Every so often we’ll say ‘Alright, this Saturday nobody’s doing anything - let’s all pitch in and clean together’.”</h4>\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Paul, consultant, 3 roommates</h3>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-2em\">“One of my roommates bought a really expensive couch and wanted us all to split the cost, but not everyone agreed with that.”</h4>\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Ryan, engineer, 2 roommates</h3>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-2em\">“One of the things we like doing is cooking together, it’s just finding the time to dedicate in our schedules to do it.”</h4>\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Nethra, student, 2 roommates</h3>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <br />\n\t\t    <br />\t\t    \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={HRInterviewMap} alt=\"Arranging notes from interviews into a journey map\" /> \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>Having all the quotes I needed to refer to posted up on the wall allowed me to step back and look at the big picture.

Despite most users not being from a creative background, I received positive feedback about how much fun it was to participate, and the sessions generated lots of interesting ideas which I later used to kickstart my prototyping process.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">These sketches shown are responses to the prompt: 'How might we allow roommates to discuss and track their household purchases? What would be the best way for roommates to log existing and propose new shared purchases, big or small?'</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRSketchSessions} alt=\"Sketch responses to an ideation prompt about discussing household purchases\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>My first round of low-fidelity prototypes were simple hand-drawn sketches of some of the most radical ideas we’d generated. For each opportunity area, I tested a minimum of two ‘polarising’ prototypes with 3 potential users. Polarising prototypes are a good way of figuring out if something is ‘good' or ‘bad', as their divisive nature inspires instinctive feedback.</p>\t        \n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">These sketches shown are two very different ways of discussing and tracking household purchases, inspired by ideas generated in the sketch sessions. The winning option was a Tinder-style app where users could upload images of shared items they wanted to purchase, and swipe left or right on other items that their roommates had suggested.</p>\t \t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRPolarisingPrototypes} alt=\"Getting user feedback on two polarising prototypes about household purchases\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>Following this initial feedback I did another round of low fidelity prototyping, this time digitising my ideas using Keynote instead of pen and paper.

I began to think about the way users would navigate between different screens and how information would be displayed on tap or swipe.  Whilst still limiting colour, I added more precision to the user interface; testing out different icons and user inputs such as sliders and tabs.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I followed a highly iterative design process, sharing each new user flow with at least one potential user and synthesising their feedback in order to improve upon the previous design. I wanted to minimise prep work by keeping things as low tech as possible until the high fidelity stage, so I stuck with paper prototypes for my mid fidelity user testing.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRPaperPrototypes} alt=\"Testing paper prototypes with a potential user\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>One important feature I wanted to trial at this stage was the idea of having an infinite scroll of household-related content, similar to a social media feed. I represented this idea on paper by printing the screens in full and cutting out a ‘phone’ frame to demonstrate how the content would load continuously and what would be visible above the fold.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">These mid fidelity prototypes mostly gave me UX-focused navigational feedback, which helped me to figure out the overall architecture of the app whilst working in tandem on the specifics of the screens. Users seemed to like the division of household tasks into separate rooms, but many found the names of the navigational sections at the bottom somewhat confusing. There was also some debate about classifying household ‘supplies' and furniture 'items' as separate categories, so as a result I decided to merge the two into a general item category. </p>\t\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={HRMidFidelityNotes} alt=\"Notes from my mid fidelity user testing\" />     \n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>System architecture</h2>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <p>Working in parallel with my mid fidelity prototypes, I developed the task flows of the app; illustrating how the user could navigate their way through the application, from the moment of download onwards. Similarly to my prototyping process, I began illustrating the journey with initial low fidelity sketches; jotting down the user’s linear actions using sketches and basic descriptions.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I initially grouped the user’s actions into three sections; Onboarding, Planning and Living.  ‘Onboarding’ referred to the process of creating an account and profile, ‘Planning’ referred to the creation of rules and tasks, and ‘Living’ referred to day-to-day activity like monitoring your calendar, chatting with roommates, etc.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRLinearFlow} alt=\"Sketching out a linear user flow\" />\t  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I shared these sketches with 2 potential users and as I previously mentioned, the navigational sections were not very easily understood. I ended up reorganising the categories into a Rules section, an Agenda section and a Mates section.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In the ‘Rules' section, users can propose new household rules, tasks and items to buy, and review their other roommates suggestions. In the ‘Agenda' section, users can take a look at the household’s shared to-do list by day or week, as well as theirs and other roommates individual calendars. In the ‘Mates' section, users can plan social events together, post messages in specific household channels, and access roommate profiles with health information, sleep habits and likes/dislikes.</p>\t\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={HRSystemDiagram} alt=\"A system diagram illustrating how screens link together\" />     \n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Visual experimentation</h2>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <p>The final stage was to develop and implement a visual system to take the app from medium to high fidelity. From the very beginning of the project, I had the idea of naming the app ‘House Rules’ and emphasising the gaming reference with rounded playing cards and fun bright colours.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">However during a brand workshop I began to explore other visual themes, and I came up with an alternative concept named ‘Blueprint’ which would have a more architectural look and feel, darker colours and sharper corners.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={HRStyleTiles} alt=\"Polarising style tiles to test with users\" />\t  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I shared the ’House Rules’ and ‘Blueprint' style tiles with potential users for feedback, and the final result was a hybrid of both; a two-toned card based design with hard edges and rounded buttons. Each communal room in the household has its own colour scheme, making it easy to see at a glance which tasks need doing in what room.</p>        \n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={HRBranding} alt=\"House Rules visual identity and design guide\" />\t  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The hero flows</h2>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-2em\">Approving Rules</h3>\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">House rules should be set from the start, but flexible enough to adapt as the household grows.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">House Rules allows roommates to decide collaboratively on what the rules of the house should be.

Rules remain pending until the entire household agrees with the decision, which helps to keep everyone involved and accountable.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <video className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={HRApprovingRulesInteraction} alt=\"A recording of the rules approval interaction\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-2em\" src={HRApprovingRulesFlow} alt=\"Showing the user flow of the rules approval process\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-2em\">Suggesting Tasks</h3>\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Discussing and tracking household items and tasks help roommates to settle any potential disputes.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">Just like house rules, regular chores like cleaning the bathroom or emptying the trash need to be universally agreed upon, as conflicts are likely to occur when things are left undone. Household purchases should also be recorded so that costs are split equally, whether it's dish soap for the kitchen or a new couch for the living room.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">House Rules allows roommates to suggest new tasks to complete or new items to purchase, allocate who is responsible for getting it done (including ‘all pitch in’ and ‘alternating’ options), and set a time/date for the job to be completed (either weekly, monthly or one-off events).</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <video className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={HRSuggestingTasksInteraction} alt=\"A recording of the task suggestion interaction\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-2em\" src={HRSuggestingTasksFlow} alt=\"Showing the user flow of the task suggestion process\" /> \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<h3 className=\"padding-top-2em\">Reviewing Plans</h3>\n\t\t    \t<h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Roommates should be kept aware of household plans for courtesy and accountability.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">House Rules automatically creates a shared agenda for the household so that everyone knows what’s happening in their home. Roommates can view their own, someone else’s, or the entire house's agenda for the day or week. Plans can be filtered by task, item or event, and roommates can choose to receive reminders of when things are due.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Whether roommate X has her girlfriend staying over on Friday, or roommate Y needs to pay the gas bill on Monday, everyone in the house is made aware and accountable. Completed tasks, items and events are always available for future reference, helping to negate arguments over who did what.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <video className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={HRReviewingPlansInteraction} alt=\"A recording of the agenda review interaction\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-2em\" src={HRReviewingPlansFlow} alt=\"Showing the user flow of the agenda review process\" /> \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My next step is to continue working on task flows for the Mates section; including creating and viewing roommate profiles, private and group messaging in household forums, and event suggestions for group activities based on roommates shared interests.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">During a presentation of my high fidelity designs to a group of designers from Redesign Health, I received some critique about the separation of tasks and items into individual rooms.

The prototype illustrates additional features such as the option to localise content to either your current city or an area of your choice.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">From your personalised dashboard you are also able to filter opportunities by cause, sort opportunities by time, and separate your feed into volunteering or donating opportunities only.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">By sitting down with 2 potential users and watching how they interacted with the prototype without instruction, I was able to witness moments of hesitation within their user journey and question them about what was confusing.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As a result of this user testing, I ended up making a clearer distinction between volunteering and donating opportunities through a colour-coded system in my high fidelity designs.</p>\t\n\t        </div>\n\t\t    <video className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ATClickable} alt=\"...\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Colour and typography</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final stages of the project were spent developing the user interface of our app, and we each created our own individual designs.

For our getting-to-know-you <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19RViC9GsvPa6NRHOeDKfh08FWthqHF_mHQ_dQLFaL6Q/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">class presentation</a>, I created this slide illustrating a few of my interests.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Slide} alt=\"Slide showing my ideas for thesis\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m still not 100% sure about my direction, as there are a couple of other avenues which I would be interested in exploring. But for now, I am settling on glossophobia. Glossophobia is a type of speech anxiety, defined by a fear of public speaking. The term is derived from the Greek word glōssa, meaning tongue.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would describe myself as an introvert who likes being around people, but when it comes to work-related situations (interviews, presentations) or social environments where I feel pressured to speak, I clam up. This is something that has affected me for as long as I can remember. In these types of situations, I have a tendency to ‘go red’, my chest starts pounding, and sometimes I find it difficult to control my voice. Even just thinking about these encounters can trigger me.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Concentrating on glossophobia for my thesis could act as a form of therapy for me, as although I’ve looked into coping mechanisms in the past, I’ve never found something that actually works. I think this is an issue that a lot of my peers suffer with too, so there would be lots of opportunity for user research and testing.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">It’s also a subject which can be interpreted in a number of ways, whether it be a digital or physical coping mechanism, an art piece triggered by the issue, or even an immersive experience demonstrating how glossophobia feels.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m not sure which direction my project will take, but I have some initial ideas right now. I did some sketches illustrating a presentation device using augmented reality. The user can take advantage of two views; the front-facing ‘selfie’ mode and the rear camera mode.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using selfie mode, the user can review their speaker notes as well as the slides they need to present. The camera will analyse their facial movements and a microphone will record their voice. The user can receive feedback on the speed of their sentences, the number of times they say certain words (eg. ‘like’), how often they smiled, etc.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Sketch} alt=\"A sketch of my AR presentation software idea\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using the rear camera mode, users can treat the device like an AR teleprompter. The screen will display speaker notes karaoke-style, and augmented reality can be used to recreate a social scene for the user to practice in. I created the paper prototype below to show how the selfie mode might work on a tablet.</p>\n\t        </div>\t   \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827PaperPrototype} alt=\"A paper prototype of the selfie mode\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would like to get some feedback on whether this is an interesting route to continue with, and if so, what kind of features should or shouldn’t be included.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog2018082;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190904MindMap from '../img/blog_20190904_mindmap.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190904 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Mind Mapping + Goal Setting</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-04</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week in class, I made a mind map around my central theme of glossophobia.

My first prototype was definitely more service oriented, and my background in UX/UI is pushing me towards a more user-focused, 'helpful' project. However, this is my thesis and I have the time to experiment and try out new things (like games).</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Storyboard} alt=\"My game storyboard\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\"> I've never made a 3D game before, so for my second prototype I'm experimenting with that format to see how I like the process and hear what other people think of this weird freaky eyeball game. The idea is that you are a character who has to give a speech in an auditorium, but in order to get there you have to take a winding, treacherous path. You have a full script to read at the beginning, but the longer it takes to get to the auditorium, the more difficult it is to read. By the time you get inside, you have lost all your words and have nothing to say. Above is a quick storyboard of how the game would progress.</p>   \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender1} alt=\"Creating a spiral shape in Blender\" />  \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender2} alt=\"Building the auditorium in Blender\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I used Blender to create the auditorium, and I set up the scene using Unity. I added a first person controller for the player to navigate the scene using their keyboard, but I'm thinking about other forms of controllers - maybe voice commands could be cool? Below is a screen recording of how it looks so far. I still need to add the interactivity - the heat/steam rising, the eyeballs turning to look at you, maybe some scary music. This is a work in progress.</p>\n\t        </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190910Unity} alt=\"A video recording of the game scene so far\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In other news, I'm happy that I managed to cross off one of my semester goals of visiting the XReality Lab (I will write more about this when I visit again). I also started to write down a list of my project's potential audience types, possible situations and environments where glossophobia could occur, the physical/mental symptoms of glossophobia, and viable technological solutions which could help ease or bring awareness to the issue.

I want to speak to past students who have done projects in the domain of public speaking, as well as people working in academia who are involved in speech and voice training. I actually found two professors within The New School, from Lang and the Mannes School of Music, so hopefully I'll be able to speak to them in person at some point. I also found some people working in XR for therapy, who would be able to give me some good tips on AR/VR techniques for anxiety.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\"> \n                I also got some advice about looking into other areas outside of public speaking such as HR and recruitment, and it got me thinking about a charity event that I used to volunteer at back in London called Crisis at Christmas. Every year around the holiday season, the Crisis centres hold a range of activities geared towards helping homeless people with shelter and comfort at Christmas. The first year I went I was an arts and crafts volunteer, but the second time I volunteered in the IT department which involved helping guests with writing resumes, sending emails, and other computer activities. Now that I'm thinking more about a specific audience, I'm wondering whether a product to help someone prepare for a job interview for example would be helpful. One thing I know is that it would need to be simple to use and relatively low tech, as the equipment at centres like this is usually very old.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">          \n                I got some good feedback from my presentation on Friday, and now I'm thinking about ways I can integrate the playful aspects of a game with a more serious method of treatment for public speaking anxiety. I went to the XReality Center at The New School last week, and this week I visited RLab in Brooklyn for my XR in the Real World class - it's given me lots of inspiration about things to experiment with. At the XReality Center I met Maya Georgieva (director of Digital Learning) and got the chance to try out the Magic Leap, which was amazing!</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190913MagicLeap} alt=\"Magic Leap equipment and glasses view of the Create UI\" /> \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The program I used was called Create - I've added a screenshot above of how the UI menu looked from inside the glasses. The Magic Leap detected the floor and walls of the center, and I was able to place blocks with gravity which toppled over if nudged. I could also place scenes, stickers and moving objects such as fish and dinosaurs. There was the option to build pipes and connecting objects; I didn’t try that enough though. I could draw around the room using various types of pens with different textures. The controller is a handheld laser pointer which I used to interact with the UI. There were three inputs - a main trigger button to control the laser, another button to bring up submenus and make other selections, and a small button on top to exit/cancel things. I could walk around the drawings I made, seeing them from the front, side and back view.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">I noticed that they had some VR programs available to try for the Oculus Gear/Go. One of them looked like it was a kind of interview prep program, so I definitely want to go back soon and check that out.  I know Samsung also have a suite of VR apps for Oculus that are geared towards public speaking, called <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/1096173157163965&ref=oculus_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#BeFearless</a>.

The concept for my AR feature is quite basic, but the technical side of it was more difficult to execute. It's still not fully working on my iPhone, but it seems to be useable on my laptop. I am testing the functionality of using my voice to control a text object in augmented reality. Sometimes the speech recogniser has trouble identifying my words. There also seems to be a bug which is causing the text to animate onto the screen twice. I’m wondering if other AI models might have better results with the speech recognition issue - I’d like to try Google Cloud Speech-to-Text next.

As you can see below, the prototype identifies when certain keywords are spoken (ie. ‘animation’, ‘design’ and ‘illustration’), and brings up a text overlay with some bullet points about that keyword (eg. ‘animation’ brings up bullet points such as ‘storyboarding’ and ‘After Effects’). Ideally, the flow before this screen would ask the user to either upload a job description or manually enter certain keywords that they want to talk about. The user would then write some bullet points to riff upon when that keyword is mentioned (either by the users or a potential interviewer on the phone).</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190924VoiceExperiment} alt=\"A video recording of my technical prototype\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In additional to the prototype, I worked on creating <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1disKj1ETAeeBrUfqPk5BGRoDZ9TuNNqi1aYMC_UliCQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a list of 35 people I’d like to interview</a> based upon my community of practise that I identified last week.

Although he doesn’t have glossophobia, he gave me some interesting things to think about. He mentioned that, as an MBA student, talking to a lot of people isn’t a big deal for him; it’s smaller groups that scare him. He hates having to do small talk. Also, being an international student from India, he found networking events very difficult as he often didn’t have any context on topics that people often casually talk about (eg. TV shows like Seinfeld, ‘trendy’ areas in New York like Williamsburg). I found this interesting as I had always thought of good public speakers being confident in all areas of socialising. I’d like to continue talking to a range of people to get some more diverse insights on the subject.</p>\n          </div>                 \t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20190924;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190930CloudSpeechToText from '../img/blog_20190930_cloudspeechtotext.mp4';\nimport Blog20190930InterviewSynthesis from '../img/blog_20190930_interviewsynthesis.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930PostItSnapshot from '../img/blog_20190930_postitsnapshot.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930QuestionsMindMap from '../img/blog_20190930_questionsmindmap.jpg';\nimport Blog20190930TectonicLecture from '../img/blog_20190930_tectoniclecture.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190930 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Questions + Challenges</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-30</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">So there’s quite a lot to talk about in this blog! I continued on with my user interviews last week; so far, I’ve spoken to three people - one with a strong fear of public speaking, one with no fear whatsoever, and one who is on the fence (only fearful when she’s unprepared). The questions I’ve been asking are based on my interviewee’s personal opinions on the topic, the speaking they’ve done in their professional lives, and the speaking they’ve done in their personal lives. I’m currently trying to get all of my notes up onto the wall, grouping them based on these three areas.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930InterviewSynthesis} alt=\"Trying to synthesise my interview notes\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’d like to talk to a couple more people if possible before drawing any conclusions, but so far I have identified some similar themes:</p>    \n              <br />\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Physical responses to fear includes leg/hands shaking involuntarily, unconsciously touching the face/neck, heart racing, increased body heat - the typical symptoms you’d expect from anxiety</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Opinions on audience eye contact while speaking is mixed - some prefer no eye contact as it makes them more nervous, some feel that no eye contact means that their speech is boring</p>              \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- There is a common theme of ‘blacking-out’ - forgetting what you’re talking about mid-sentence and having to refer back to slides/notes or in worst cases fleeing the scene entirely</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Those comfortable with English preferred to look at certain keywords they had written down in their notes, while those who were less comfortable with English preferred to be able to see the full sentence/script of what they should say</p>    \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- All of the people I spoke to said they feel most confident and comfortable performing when they have practiced their speaking over and over again and know their subject matter very well</p>               \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Most of them had done some public speaking outside of work/school, ranging from anchoring an event to hosting a workshop with friends</p>    \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- None of them displayed any strong social anxiety at non work-related events such as parties, although they all said they disliked ‘small talk’ and found it difficult to come up with things to say</p>\n              <br />\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Once I’ve finished all of my user interviews, I’ll try to synthesise everything somehow and try to identify some key areas to address in my project.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930PostItSnapshot} alt=\"Learnings from one of my interviews\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week I also participated in an interesting workshop for my Cornell Tech Product Studio program. The <a href=\"https://www.tectonictheaterproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tectonic Theater Project</a> are a company based in New York who are known for their trademarked theater-making method, Moment Work™. Alongside developing new plays, the company works with educational institutions such as Cornell Tech to improve student's public speaking skills. We were given an engaging lecture by Scott Barrow, who explained how to make our ideas ‘leap forward’ when presenting an important pitch. He mentioned the importance of the presentation when selling an idea, noting that the ‘bowl’ is often more memorable than what’s in it (the content). He also talked about the common responses to public speaking - grouping them as ‘emotional, cerebral, physiological, and behavioral’ - which I thought was interesting.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930TectonicLecture} alt=\"Tectonic Theater Project lecture at Cornell Tech\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">After the lecture we broke into groups and practised 4 steps to communicating effectively: 1. Connecting with your audience (eye contact), 2. Using your body to communicate effectively and demonstrate ease (open arms, non-defensive body language), 3. Using your vocal presence to convey your message (speaking clearly, maybe using humour and humility), 4. Finishing strong (offering a conclusion). Grant Varjas was the faculty member that led the workshop for my group; I managed to speak to him after the class and mentioned my thesis project, so hopefully I’ll be able to talk to him at some point about the Tectonic Theater Project and public speaking.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As far as prototyping, I am continuing to experiment with different speech to text APIs to see which would be the most effective for my project. I had heard good things about Google Cloud Speech-To-Text so I created an account; it was definitely a lot more difficult to set up than IBM Watson, but that is probably due to me using node.js instead of Unity/C#. I managed to create a test app which allowed me to transcribe real-time voice streaming via Terminal.</p>\n          </div>    \n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190930CloudSpeechToText} alt=\"A video recording of my Google Cloud Speech to Text on Terminal\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m still working on how to use this real-time voice streaming in a web browser to control other Javascript functions. I’d like to create an AR prototype similar to my last one, but using WebXR technologies instead of Unity, so I’m curious to see if the two API’s will play well together. I found out that Javascript actually has a free built-in Web Speech API which can do basic speech recognition for voice commands, so depending on the form that my project takes, that might be all I need. But for more accurate voice transcription (and maybe extra features like translation/punctuation/grammar stuff), a paid API from Google Cloud, IBM Watson or Microsoft Azure would be necessary.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Finally, I have been reflecting this weekend on the areas that I’ve explored so far as far as research and prototyping. Starting to form my concept statement has helped me to narrow down the direction in which I want to go, but there are definitely a few holes in the plan which I need to fill before the end of the semester. I tried to identify my key domains in this mind map, and highlighted in red the things which I am most unsure about.</p>\n          </div>       \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190930QuestionsMindMap} alt=\"Mind mapping my questions and challenges for my project\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My key challenge is probably going to be figuring out how to implement all the features that I want to include. I’m trying to get a head-start on the voice integration stuff, as I know that will be necessary for whatever my final product will be. I think that as long as I know exactly what technologies I want to use, I will be able to talk to my professors and get some tutoring over the next few months and learn how to fit everything together. I still don’t know how I’m going to integrate AR into my project though. Although I’m very interested in AR headsets like Magic Leap and Hololens, I really want whatever I make to be something that the everyday person can access without needing expensive technology. But I’m worried that AR might not be right for this project. I need to figure out quickly a useful way of implementing it, or just scrap the idea altogether.</p>\n          </div>  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As far as my weak spots, I know that I need to figure out a consistent schedule to balance my thesis work along with all my other classes. I need to ensure that I’m getting enough sleep and not working too late into the night which is a bad habit of mine. I also need to connect with other Design and Technology faculty and students who have experience in the areas that I need help with. As I was in Communication Design last year I really don’t know anybody from DT, so I’m going to have to try and reach out and get to know people more.</p>\n          </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20190930;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191006IncorrectBPM from '../img/blog_20191006_incorrectbpm.mp4';\nimport Blog20191006ARjsWebRecording from '../img/blog_20191006_arjswebrecording.mp4';\nimport Blog20191006PulseSensor from '../img/blog_20191006_pulsesensor.jpg';\nimport Blog20191006ARjsCode from '../img/blog_20191006_arjscode.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191006 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Fourth Technical Prototype</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-10-06</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last Thursday I had to present an idea in front of two crit judges for one of my class projects. Myself and my team had completely changed the theme/slides of our presentation 30 mins before, and as a result, I was VERY nervous. All I had to do was introduce our team and give a brief introduction to the idea, but my heart was pounding so fast that I could look down and see the fabric of my shirt quivering. I knew that the reason for these extreme nerves was my lack of preparation, but at that point what can you do! We obviously should’ve prepared more thoroughly, but it was too late for second chances.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">While my heart was thumping I started thinking about this thesis project for obvious reasons, and it actually eased the pounding a bit to concentrate on something different. I also tried breathing deeply, which is my usual go-to method. I think it helped a bit. But as soon as I started thinking about the presentation again the crazy thumping returned, and as our turn neared (unfortunately we were last to present) it was just out of control and felt ridiculous; I was convinced that as I approached the front everyone would notice my chest thumping and my body shaking. In that period of time before standing up to present, I really wished that I had something that could take the edge off somehow.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">On Saturday, I decided to begin making a prototype to test how someone might calm their nerves by visualising their heart rate decreasing. This is not a novel invention - many people have created digital products to help reduce anxiety such as Healium and Solace by Oscar de la Hera. However, I couldn’t find any augmented reality products which specifically target those glossophobia nerves that you tend to get right before a presentation. I think this prototype could possibly be developed further, and integrated into a preparatory public speaking ‘system’.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191006PulseSensor} alt=\"The Arduino pulse sensor\" />            \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What is it?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">A technical prototype to test connecting a physical pulse sensor with an augmented reality object. I am interested in whether being able to visualise your heart-rate reducing can in turn reduce anxiety.</p>   \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Why should people care?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Studies show that biofeedback, the idea of becoming more aware of your body's responses when you're stressed and anxious, can promote relaxation. Biofeedback types can include brain waves, sweat gland activity and heart-rate.</p>               \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What goals does this prototype serve?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Gives the user their heart-rate in beats per minute</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- Allows the user to see that data visualised in augmented reality</p>\n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What should the audience know?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This is a feature that would be best used before a big event, such as a speech or job interview, to help ease the user’s nerves. As it can be accessed quickly through any web browser, it is perfect for last-minute stress relief.</p>     \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What are the constraints and/or specifications?</h2>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The prototype requires a marker to activate the AR experience. This is something that could perhaps be incorporated into a preparatory public speaking ‘kit’, containing physical items such as cue cards, stress balls, etc.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191006IncorrectBPM} alt=\"Showing the incorrect BPM reading from the Arduino pulse sensor\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As you can see above, the prototype uses an Arduino pulse sensor to detect my pulse in beats per minute (which is obviously very wrong - I’m still trying to configure this!) and sends the data to a local server using Johnny-Five, socket.io and express. I was then able to style the page (nothing crazy for now, just white text on a black background) using HTML/CSS. For the next part of this prototype idea, I incorporated AR.js into my HTML/CSS page. AR.js is an efficient and highly accessible solution that uses A-Frame to render augmented reality on the web. It runs 100% in your web browser with no separate app to install. You can’t do as much with it as you can with Unity/Vuforia, but I think it’s pretty cool that it works without having to download anything extra.</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191006ARjsWebRecording} alt=\"A video recording of the AR.js prototype\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I created a simple sphere shape with the beats per minute rate in the centre to show the basic mechanism of my idea. Ideally instead of a sphere, the 3D entity could be a beating heart or some other model that animates depending on the heart rate. Unfortunately, I still haven’t managed to connect the code from the Arduino to the AR.js model - the BPM rate is currently showing in the console but not rendering in the a-frame. Hopefully in time I’ll be able to figure out a solution. For now, I would like to share this concept with other people and see if this might be an interesting route to continue with.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191006ARjsCode} alt=\"The AR.js and Arduino code together, but not as one :(\" />  \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20191006;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191016Glitch from '../img/blog_20191016_glitch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016Tinkercad from '../img/blog_20191016_tinkercad.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016WebXR from '../img/blog_20191016_webxr.jpg';\nimport Blog20191016Meetup from '../img/blog_20191016_meetup.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191016 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Midterm Presentations + WebXR</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-10-16</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week I presented my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1msb9TBAYYvYoR1dxglIRhwKs8chpdWERV1MSPtvp2_I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">midterm thesis proposal</a> to two guest critiques, my professors, and my classmates. I feel that my research was thorough but the actual presentation could have gone better; I was nervous as always, and one of my prototypes failed to load (I think the GIF was too large) which was a big fail, as I would have liked to have gotten some more feedback on this particular direction. It just goes to show that you should always have a backup plan! (or a backup video). Below is my reflection on the feedback I received.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Prioritize - what is the most important item (or two items) of feedback?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The most important critique I got was to reexamine my audience and try to zero in on specific user needs, rather than generalising and trying to cater to everybody. By identifying a variety of precise use cases and designing something explicitly for them, I might find that this very specific problem could actually prove to be helpful to a broader audience.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The other important piece of feedback I received was to think about areas that are completely unrelated (and possibly the complete opposite) to what I envision my project to be. Right now I am pretty firm on XR most likely being my final form, but by trying other things maybe I’ll discover something unique, rather than building upon AR/VR things that people have already tried. One very different point of comparison could be looking into physical training, done by athletes, dancers and musicians - could their methods of focusing/concentrating on their goals be applied to public speaking in some way?</p>\n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Compare to feedback from earlier in the semester - are there patterns that emerge?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My guest critique Barbara Morris commented on bringing a humorous element into my project. I received a similar piece of feedback earlier in the semester, and although I did initially try the game prototype, this funny and playful element is obviously still missing from my current work.</p>               \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Do you have any follow-up questions? How do you plan to respond to the feedback?</h4>   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would really like to have gotten some feedback on the ‘AI’ prototype that I created. As the GIF wasn’t working during the presentation, I might try to share my blog post about this prototype with my guest critiques, to see what they think of this approach vs. the heart rate sensor one that they saw.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’d also like to try and meet with Justin Bakse regarding some of the precedents that he mentioned I look into (specifically papers on the Apple earpods). I’m planning to get in contact with someone from the undergrad’s Game Club, to see if they have a Nintendo Switch that I can play with (I’d like to try out the 1-2 Switch game that Justin mentioned).</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Meetup} alt=\"The WebXR Meetup at RLab\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Now that midterms are over, I’m concentrating on reaching out to people in my community of practice. I’ve emailed a number of experts in the field of psychology, computer science, theater and voice training, so hopefully I’ll be able to arrange some in-person and over-the-phone interviews during the next few weeks. I also attended a WebXR Meetup on Tuesday evening at the RLab in Brooklyn which was very insightful. I chatted with a number of developers, designers and students from various companies and schools (I was the only person from Parsons there), and I’d definitely like to keep in contact with the people I spoke to.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Tinkercad} alt=\"Building a simple glTF model in Tinkercad\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">During the event we learnt about the possibilities of WebXR, and it’s accessibility advantages over traditional VR headsets due to being able to work within the web browser. I learned that although the technology is still evolving all the time, WebXR is currently very close to becoming stabilised, so it's definitely something that developers should consider switching to (particularly those coming from a WebGL background). I also found out that the API supports 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) and works with frameworks such as three.js, A-Frame, Babyon.js and React.js.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016Glitch} alt=\"Coding in Glitch\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final part of the meetup was a quick ‘code-along’ tutorial to making a simple WebXR scene using A-Frame, Tinkercad and Glitch. I was amazed at how fast and easy it was to get a glTF model uploaded and working in 3D in the browser - the whole tutorial including modelling took less than 20 minutes! Above is the code we tweaked in Glitch, and below is how the scene renders in WebXR. Although I’ve kind of been ‘against’ VR up until this point due to there being so many VR public speaking tools out there already, it’s definitely a form that I’d like to play with a bit. One of the critiques that I received from Justin Bakse was that low-budget VR headsets like Google Cardboard are actually cheaper than smartphones. Now that I’ve learnt a bit about WebXR and experienced how easy A-Frame is to work with, one of my next steps is to buy a Google Cardboard and create some quick VR prototypes to test with specific users.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191016WebXR} alt=\"The WebXR experience, live in the browser!\" />            \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20191016;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191103PrepareResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_prepareresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PreparePrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_prepareprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PrepareTest from '../img/blog_20191103_preparetest.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PractiseResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_practiseresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PractisePrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_practiseprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WarmUpResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_warmupresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WarmUpPrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_warmupprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WarmUpTest from '../img/blog_20191103_warmuptest.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103CalmDownResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_calmdownresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103CalmDownPrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_calmdownprototype.gif';\nimport Blog20191103CalmDownTest from '../img/blog_20191103_calmdowntest.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PerformResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_performresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PerformPrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_performprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103PerformTest from '../img/blog_20191103_performtest.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103ReflectResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_reflectresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103ReflectPrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_reflectprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WildcardResearch from '../img/blog_20191103_wildcardresearch.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WildcardPrototype from '../img/blog_20191103_wildcardprototype.jpg';\nimport Blog20191103WildcardTest from '../img/blog_20191103_wildcardtest.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191103 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">7 Prototypes in 7 Days</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-11-03</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This blog is all about my 7 in 7 assignment, in which we were asked to create a seven prototypes over the course of seven days. Each day’s prototype poses and answers a question concerning a particular assumption I have about my thesis project. The goal was to start and finish each prototype in a single day, so as a result, most of the prototypes are quite low fidelity. I decided to approach my prototypes in terms of the six key stages of public speaking which I had previously identified; Prepare, Practice, Warm up, Calm down, Perform and Reflect. The seventh prototype was a wildcard option which I wanted to try out.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Although I haven’t tested all of my prototypes with a wide audience, the one that seemed to gain the most interest so far was the memorization game. I was surprised that people seemed to understand the concept, as the Leitner system is not something that I personally was familiar with before this project. The prototype that gained the least engagement was the first UI paper prototype exercise, which coincidentally was one of the most time consuming prototypes to make. In hindsight I think I probably should have made a wider variety of screens for people to give their feedback on, instead of just the two directions I presented. This also could have easily been an on-screen exercise instead of paper, which was very fiddly and tedious to make.</p>\n          </div>\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">1. 'Prepare' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How should my audience set their public speaking goals?</h4>     \n          </div>              \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PrepareResearch} alt=\"Researching into existing apps\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This prototype addresses the preparation stage of public speaking. I wanted to try and find the best UI onboarding experience for a mobile app. As public speaking spans many situations, the user would need to input their specific goal (eg. presenting slides, networking, etc.). The user might also want to specify how big their audience will be, as the experience of giving a speech in front of 5 or 6 people is very different to 100+ people. Finally, the user would need to input the specific time and date of their public speaking event, so that the app can notify them to practice in time. Above is my research into existing onboarding screens from some of my favourite apps.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PreparePrototype} alt=\"The paper prototypes\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I decided to create paper prototypes with various UI elements for my user testers to play with. I had two specific flows in mind; the first being a textual design in which users edit pre filled fields using dropdown menus and sliders, and the second being a visual design in which users swipe through illustrations of their goals and adjust the details on later screens. My user testers seemed to create similar designs to the ones I’d initially thought of, but this was probably because there wasn’t much opportunity to create something new! Overall, I didn’t really learn that much from this prototype. However when asked which design they preferred, most people said that the visual option was more appealing. In moving forward with my final concept, I’ll probably try to make these onboarding screens more visual.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PrepareTest} alt=\"Testing the paper prototype exercise with a friend\" />\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">2. 'Practise' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How can I help my audience memorise their content?</h4>                   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’ve been doing some research into various memorization techniques, and one style that stood out to me was the Leitner System. There are a few old-school software programs that follow this style of revision, such as Anki, Mnemosyne, and SuperMemo. These programs allow you to create digital flashcards and rate how well you know the content of the cards. Based on this rating, the program’s algorithm will generate the perfect pattern of cards to test you with. Lower rated cards will be shown more frequently, as these are the cards that need the most practise. Higher rated cards will still be shown but at less frequent intervals, as you already know the content pretty well. I’ve personally never used programs like these but apparently they are widely used by medical and language students. I wanted to emulate these techniques of spaced repetition and active recall testing in an AR environment, as the act of somatic learning (moving and doing) is a method of study that many of these programs do not incorporate.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PractiseResearch} alt=\"Researching different methods of memorisation\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I created some fake flashcards for this prototype, with the front showing bullet points of what the user wants to talk about, and the back showing the actual script of exactly what they want to say. I decided to include the script element as many of the non-native English speakers I interviewed said how difficult it was to speak with the correct grammar. My idea is that these cards would not be actually printed, but would be made out of a whiteboard-like material that you write on with a marker. The AR part of the experience is activated using image targets printed onto the card boxes. Scanning the targets using the app will recreate the scene in front of you in augmented reality. Instead of moving the card in real-life, the user would drag the digital card into the AR box of their choosing.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The principle behind doing this digitally is that the app’s algorithm would be able to ‘shuffle’ the cards into a specific order, and provide the user with a prioritised deck of cards based on the time/date of their event. The app could also notify users with reminders to practice, and adjust the prioritised card deck based on how frequently they actually practised (eg. if the user ends up practising only twice, then it makes sense that during that last session the lower rated cards are shown over and over again in order to ‘cram’ the information in a short space of time).</p>              \n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PractisePrototype} alt=\"The AR Leitner System prototype\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I received a lot of positive engagement from this prototype; many users hadn’t tried this method of study before, and thought that it would be quite effective. They also liked the gamified elements that I added into the prototype, such as the points score and the money sound when a card is dropped into a box. However, a few people noted that the AR part of it was redundant - the same technique could work just as well as a regular app or even a physical game. This final attempt at AR will probably be my last, as I’m realising now that I need to stop forcing this technology into all of my prototypes! For my final concept, I will design a similar practise experience without the use of augmented reality.</p>           \n          </div>            \n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">3. 'Warm up' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Could improv exercises help my audience feel more comfortable at networking events?</h4>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WarmUpResearch} alt=\"Pictures from the Improv NOW! Meetup\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">When getting ready to speak at an event, sometimes it’s helpful to loosen up both your voice and your inhibitions in order to get into the right frame of mind for public speaking. In the case of a networking event, a person suffering from public speaking anxiety might find it difficult to spark up a conversation with a stranger. I recently attended a Meetup event called Improv NOW! which focuses on long-form improv workshops for people who are looking to become more comfortable and spontaneous with public speaking. Above are some pictures from the event, and some of the many activities that we did throughout the evening.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WarmUpPrototype} alt=\"The improv game prototype\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Although I was a bit apprehensive about attending, the workshop was actually a lot of fun and it inspired me to create this fun 2-player improv game, geared towards shy audiences who are attending networking events. To start the game, both players will choose a card stating a random person’s name. Each player must then take on the character of this imaginary person, and have a conversation based on a specific networking scenario (for example, A might be interested in working at B’s company). As time goes on, more cards are given to the players stating their character’s job, hometown and passion. The players must adapt the conversation to relay this new information to their partner in a natural way. The main rule of the game is that players should respond positively to whatever is said to them, as during real improv, literally anything goes and nothing is wrong or silly.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WarmUpTest} alt=\"Testing the game with two friends\" />          \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I tested the game with two of my friends right before we attended a university networking event. Both thought that the game was fun to play, but neither thought that it made much of a difference to the way they acted during the actual event. One reason for that might be that the game asks both players to take on the role of a character - perhaps only one person should be acting, and the other person should just play themselves. Another comment I got was to add a personality card into the mix (although perhaps this might take away from the improvisation aspect of the game), as well as introducing some ‘random’ events during the scenario such as a dog passing by or a loud noise. Overall people seemed to react positively to this prototype, so I might consider including improv as a warm up exercise as I move forward with my final concept.</p>\n          </div>  \n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">4. 'Calm down' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Can breathing techniques help to calm my audience’s nerves?</h4>                   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Since the midterm presentations, I’ve been thinking about ways to incorporate mindfulness and meditation into my concept somehow. I did some research into different methods of meditation, and I found out about various deep breathing techniques that are commonly used to ease anxiety. I wanted to try and recreate one of these breathing exercises using Google Cardboard, as VR is a medium that I haven’t really explored yet and Google Cardboard is an affordable alternative to more expensive VR headsets. This concept is building upon a previous prototype I created which connects an Arduino pulse sensor with an augmented reality object, showing the users heart rate in beats per minute. In this prototype, I am simulating a similar scene but this time in virtual reality, using a smartphone camera instead of an Arduino to measure heart rate whilst guiding the user through a breathing exercise. The BPM rating isn’t actually real, but I wanted to simulate the heart rate going down in order to gauge whether it would have an actual effect on the user experience.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103CalmDownResearch} alt=\"Research into breathing techniques\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I tested this prototype with a couple of friends, and both seemed to enjoy being in this calming virtual environment. Surprisingly, both said that the heart rate going down wasn’t very important to them, and one commented that she’d prefer to see this data after the breathing meditation had ended (perhaps as some sort of data visualisation). Some additional comments I got were to add customisable music depending on what the person finds relaxing, and to have different types of meditation to choose from based on the person’s anxiety level. Both noted that the VR aspect of the prototype isn’t very convenient for someone feeling anxious right before an event, but perhaps the same experience could be recreated in a mobile app with headphones. Overall, this prototype received good engagement and I would like to integrate it into my final concept.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103CalmDownPrototype} alt=\"The virtual visualisation\" />\n          <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103CalmDownTest} alt=\"Testing the VR prototype\" />\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">5. 'Perform' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">What kind of tool could help my audience in the moment?</h4>    \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PerformResearch} alt=\"Researching tactile presentation props\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">                                       \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">For this prototype, I was thinking about various objects that could possibly calm people’s anxiety whilst also playing a role during the physical act of public speaking. Clicker remotes are commonly used to change slides during presentations, but their hardware and functionality hasn’t really evolved much over the years (although there are some interesting ring designs on the market). In terms of reducing anxiety, many people use fidget toys as a distraction and a way to release nervous energy. Fidget spinners were huge a few years ago, and there are many other fun little gadgets on the market with various knobs, buttons and switches for people to fiddle with. In this prototype, I decided to fuse the two and design a fidget clicker for presentations.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PerformPrototype} alt=\"The fidget clicker prototype\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The clicker has a double sided design with two handy LED screens; one displays the upcoming and previous slides so users are aware of what’s coming next, and the other displays the users bullet point speaker notes in case they forget what they’ve planned to say. There is a laser pointer to allow users to highlight specific areas on screen. Along the sides of the remote, there are sliders, buttons, rollerballs and joysticks for users to twiddle with whilst presenting to ease their nerves. They have no functionality, but are specifically positioned on the sides for easy access and so as not to compete with the actual functional buttons on the front and back of the clicker. I shared this prototype with some friends and it received a good response, although the ‘fidget’ features were not immediately recognised due to them being flat 2D drawings instead of real 3D components. I’m not sure if a physical device is something that I want to pursue for my final concept, but I think the idea is interesting and I would like to get some more opinions on it.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103PerformTest} alt=\"Testing the clicker with friends\" />\n\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">6. 'Reflect' prototype</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How can my audience track their progress with public speaking?</h4>                   \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In thinking about ways to track progress, I decided to map out all of the possible data points that a public speaking app could track and analyse. I found that the practise and performance stages would most likely be tracking similar things, such as the pace/pitch of your voice, and how accurate your spoken content is compared to your written notes. I also recently attended a Toastmasters meeting, and I discovered that keeping to a specific time limit is a big pain point for this particular audience. Keeping these things in mind, I decided to design a screen which allows users to view data about their progress with public speaking.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103ReflectResearch} alt=\"Mapping out possible data points\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Below is the screen prototype so far. At the top, the user can choose which ‘big talk’ they want to view, as some people might practice for multiple public speaking goals within the same time frame. Once the user has selected which goal they want to view, they can either access the data from their practice sessions or from the actual event. Being able to record and review how their actual performance went could be helpful for future improvements. If the user hasn’t yet ‘performed’ their big talk, then they can view their overall progress during all practice sessions or choose to focus on one particular session. At the bottom I’ve included some stats on the user’s overall progress since using the app, such as the total number of hours they’ve practised and their favourite in-app exercises. I haven’t tested this prototype with anyone yet, but I’m curious to hear people’s feedback. I’m thinking that there could be a gamified aspect to this progress screen, such as a community leaderboard and/or progress badges.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103ReflectPrototype} alt=\"The screen prototype\" />\n\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <h2 className=\"padding-top-1em\">7. The Wildcard</h2> \n              <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Can I replicate the anxiety that my audience feels on stage?</h4>    \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WildcardResearch} alt=\"Other technology helmet precedents\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">                                       \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This final prototype doesn’t fit into any of the categories, but is instead addressing the issue of my audience not feeling the same anxiety whilst practising their public speaking as they do when actually performing in the moment. I wanted to try and find a way to make people feel anxious during or right before practice, so that they are able to adjust to performing with that nervous energy and perhaps find a way to use it to their advantage. I had the idea of creating some kind of anxiety helmet, so I began looking at similar precedents from artists such as Ani Liu and Joshua Smith. I was also inspired by the sliding covers that many people use on their phones and laptops to block their camera from seeing them.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WildcardPrototype} alt=\"Making the helmet\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The concept behind this prototype is that when the user is alone, the sliding eye panel stays closed, but when it senses that other people are nearby or that someone is looking directly at the person wearing this weird helmet thing, the sliding panel will automatically open, leaving the user feeling exposed and vulnerable. I chose pink because it’s a loud colour that might hopefully draw attention from passers by, and I drew squiggles on the inside of the eye panel to try and make the user feel uncomfortable even whilst in the privacy of the helmet. I tested this prototype out with a friend standing in the middle of Fifth Ave, but even in this busy area the helmet didn’t seem to draw much attention from passers by. She commented that although she did feel a bit strange wearing it, she was able to see through a gap in the panel that nobody was really looking at her. If I were to redo this prototype, I would create a more robust helmet with no way of seeing through it, and I would perhaps decorate the outside a bit more to grab people’s attention. Although I probably won’t continue with this idea for my final concept, it was a fun prototype to make and try out.</p>\n          </div>   \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191103WildcardTest} alt=\"Testing the helmet with a friend\" />\n\n\n\n          <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20191103;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191117Figma from '../img/blog_20191117_figma.jpg';\nimport Blog20191117Flashcard from '../img/blog_20191117_cardflip.mp4';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191117 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n          <div id=\"title\">Low-Fidelity Design + Code</div>\n          <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n            <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n          </div>\n      </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <br />\n            <br />\n              <h3>2019-11-17</h3>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">With only four weeks left until the Thesis Pop Up show, I need to make a decision on what to make as a proof of concept prototype. Ideally I’d like to create a mobile app, but in the interest of time, I think a responsive web app is more doable. I’d also like to experiment with either WebVR or Unity 3D, but it’ll take me longer than a month to figure out the voice integration part of my project in these mediums. And, while my final product will hopefully encompass all of the six areas of public speaking I’d previously identified, for this December 10th deadline I’m just going to focus on three.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">So, here is my goal for the next four weeks: I want to help my audience with public speaking by providing them with a mobile friendly platform to Prepare, Practise and Perform their content. They will be able to prepare flashcards on their talking points of choice, use the cards to practise reciting their big speech, as well as refer to the cards as a visual aid whilst performing. Voice recognition technology will power this platform, allowing users to create flashcards on the go by dictating into their device’s microphone. Whilst practicing their content, the website will compare the users speech to their original script, providing feedback on content accuracy as well as vocal volume and pitch. During the final performance the user can choose to either scroll through their flashcards manually, or activate the ‘listen’ mode, where the platform will automatically show flashcards based on specific keywords it hears.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191117Figma} alt=\"Creating wireframes in Figma\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last weekend I started creating some wireframes in Figma to illustrate how my platform, tentatively named ‘Big Talk’, will actually work. I’m still reworking some parts; particularly the feedback screen where the user is able to review how their voice sounded and how accurate their content was. I had initially chosen to represent vocal pitch on a scale ranging from ‘monotone’ to ‘exciting’, but after speaking to my professor I realised that it should be up to the user to define how their varied their pitch is. So now I’m thinking about finding a way to visualise the pitch data on a graph instead. I’m still looking for Javascript libraries that could help me with this; so far I’ve found a platform called <a href=\"https://www.deepaffects.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpeechAffects</a> which has a Paralinguistic Feature Extraction API, and there’s also a library called <a href=\"https://ml5js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ml5.js</a> which offers a PitchDetection algorithm. I plan to experiment with both of these next week.</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191117Flashcard} alt=\"The basic web app framework\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This weekend I managed to create a basic framework for the responsive web app based on my original Figma wireframes. I am using CSS and Javascript/jQuery for the flashcard flipping interaction, and Firebase to store the data that the user inputs. I’ve also managed to figure out how to hook up Javascript’s built-in Web Speech API, but I haven’t actually implemented it yet. I want to get the general ‘create a flashcard’ and ‘load a flashcard’ functionality sorted out first. I’m somewhat confident that I’ll be able to get things working in sync by next Sunday. I have a friend visiting for a week over Thanksgiving and I doubt I’ll be able to get much work done, so I’d like to get this major stuff out of the way as soon as possible!</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Although I’m keen to start thinking about the branding for this project (colour scheme, logo, typography, animations, etc.) - I’m not sure I’ll have enough time to go too deep into it. But if we’re having an end of the year show, it might be nice to show something a bit prettier than grey wireframes. I’ll see how things go... I think the main goal at the moment is to just get something working.</p>\n          </div>        \n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <br />\n      </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20191117;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20191202Responsive from '../img/blog_20191202_responsive.mp4';\nimport Blog20191202Firebase from '../img/blog_20191202_firebase.png';\nimport Blog20191202Script from '../img/blog_20191202_script.png';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20191202 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n          <div id=\"title\">Figuring out Firebase</div>\n          <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n            <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n          </div>\n      </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <br />\n            <br />\n              <h3>2019-12-02</h3>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week was Thanksgiving and I had a friend visiting from London, so I didn’t get to do nearly as much work as I would have liked. I’ve also been struggling with the process of saving and retrieving data through Firebase, but I finally managed to find a solution this morning after reading through the documentation and discovering the ‘child added’ event. Using ‘child added’ to retrieve the data instead of ‘value’ allows the web app to update automatically whenever a new flashcard is created.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191202Script} alt=\"The code for saving and retrieving data\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">As you can see below, in the Firebase console each flashcard entry has a unique key with a string of letters. I was having a lot of trouble trying to attach this key to a specific ID in the HTML, but by using ‘child added’ I was able to access the ‘snapshot.key’ and save it as a variable which could then be inserted dynamically into the DOM. When the user clicks on a mini talking point card, the data associated with that key will render in the saved card popup.</p>              \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20191202Firebase} alt=\"The Firebase console\" />\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Below is a quick screen recording of the web app so far. Being able to save and retrieve data is one of the key parts of my project (aside from the voice stuff), so I’m happy that I managed to get this functionality working. The layout is also now responsive and working on both desktop (mouse click) and mobile (touch). I have integrated the jQuery UI library into the app, which allows me to drag and drop these mini cards around the page. One of my next steps will be figuring out how to merge these talking points into a ‘big talk’ series of cards.</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20191202Responsive} alt=\"The web app scaling responsively\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-1em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My three week goal for my thesis is to create a working web application which will allow a user to create their own flashcards, review them in a specific order, and practise their speaking. My next big hurdle will be integrating the voice recognition and analysis, but as I have already found some APIs which could help me, I’m hoping it won’t be too difficult. I’ve found that it’s impossible for me to get my head into the coding stuff if I have less than 2 hours to spare, so I’m planning to work solely on my thesis on Fridays and Saturdays, and complete my assignments for other classes outside of this time.
