Using sites like these as my precedents, I wanted to create a similarly playful experience but with an underlying message; the importance of colour contrast in web accessibility.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also wanted to try my hand at building something a bit trickier using JavaScript than I had tried previously. My initial idea was to just create a website educating users about the issue, but this would have relied mostly on HTML and CSS. Building a game with multiple functions would be more challenging and rewarding.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAMobile} alt=\"Screenshots of the mobile view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Colour and contrast</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Web accessibility is a huge topic to tackle. It encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. I decided to concentrate on the visual issue of adequate colour contrast, which is vital to accessibility as all web users should be able to perceive content on the page.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> measure the difference in perceived \"luminance\" or brightness between two colors, and provide web content creators with a minimum contrast ratio for legible text. Accessibility is measured by two levels of conformance; AA (average) and AA (above average). To meet the minimum level AA, small text below 18pt must have a ratio of at least 4.5 to 1, and large text above 18pt must have a ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CADesktopImage} alt=\"Screenshot of the desktop view\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The big idea</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I decided to design and build a quiz game application for fellow creatives to guess whether a particular colour combination’s contrast ratio is a pass or a fail. Pass/fail results of foreground text and background colours are easily accessed through the public WebAIM Color Contrast Checker API. This game has 10 combinations in total, which are loaded into the game via an external JSON file.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Users receive feedback after each combination on whether their guess was successful, and at the end of the quiz they receive their final score out of 10 along with a customised message. An integrated scoreboard and timer enhance the gamified experience, and social media sharing links at the end encourage users to spread awareness of the game and issue.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Testing the API</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">After outlining the concept, I began testing the functionality with a dummy question in order to get the API connected and functioning correctly. My test code below is asking the WebAIM API whether each colour combination passes or fails the accessibility test. The code is then checking the pass/fail result against the users yes/no guess, and either displaying a “Correct!” message or a “Wrong” message. In this test, the background and text colours are hard-coded into my JS file.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASuccessfulAPI} alt=\"Using developer tools to test the functionality\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The learning curve</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The next step was to compile multiple question variables - each with their own background and text colour properties - into an external JSON file. My initial plan was to load each question into a div in my HTML file, and use CSS to remove and display each div one by one. However, I had a lot of difficulty in getting the JS checking code to work for multiple questions.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CABrokenButtons} alt=\"Screenshot of the console log\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I did a lot of debugging and realised the code was displaying the correct message for questions 1 and 2, but advancing to question 3 only displayed the message from the previous question. The code for question 3 definitely worked as the console log showed that it had executed, but the message was being overwritten by question 2. I needed to find a way to execute the code one step at a time only.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>My 'Aha!' moment</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The biggest revelation I had during this project was my discovery of the 'unbind' method. The reason why my most recent code kept getting overwritten by previous functions was because I was attaching all my click events to the same two buttons. I had to unbind the click event from the Agree and Disagree button IDs after each loadQuestion() function had run, in order to start afresh each time.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAUnbind} alt=\"Screenshot of the unbind method in Sublime\" />\t  \t\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed the visual interface of my game using Figma, ensuring that the UI was colourful, engaging, and above all, accessible! Using Figma helped me to structure my CSS code quickly and easily, as it automatically provides you with CSS properties in the sidebar which you can quickly paste into your style sheet.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CAFigma} alt=\"Artboards in Figma\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>To introduce the website I designed an introductory panel which explained what the game was about, and gave users a brief introduction to the colour contrast accessibility topic. At the end of the game I provided links for the user to learn more about the official web accessibility guidelines.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In order to increase the gamified aspect of the experience, I integrated a scoreboard and timer by utilising the 'setTimeout' method. This allowed me to display a Correct/Incorrect for a certain period of time, and then advance the user on to the next question.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASetTimeOut} alt=\"Screenshot of the setTimeout method in Sublime\" />\n\t\t    <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={CATabletVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of the game on tablet\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>I also upped the game-like intensity by adding a timebar, which would start out as green at 0 seconds and then eventually switch to red as the time was approaching 5 seconds. I used the 'animate' method to increase the CSS width of the bar as time increased.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Finally, I added a customised sentiment message at the end of the quiz depending on the user's final score. Users that scored 10 out of 10 would receive a 'perfect score!' message, whilst users that scored less than 1 received a 'did you even try?!' message.</p>\t\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={CASentimentMessage} alt=\"Screenshot of the sentiment if/else statements in Sublime\" />\t        \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My next steps are to sort out a bug I'm having with the 'replay' button at the end of the quiz, and to add in the Twitter 'retweet' functionality in order to spread awareness of the game. I would also like to integrate some more animation and perhaps illustrations into the game, in order to make the experience more fun and enjoyable. I think the customised message at the end could perhaps include some sort of fireworks animation if the user scores 10 out of 10.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://github.com/madspesh/WebAdvanced_Spring2019_gillr456/tree/master/Finals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View on GitHub</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n      \t</div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default CAProjectPage;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ARPhoneVideo from '../img/aeropress_phonevideo.mp4';\nimport ARCoffeeBreakdownVideo from '../img/aeropress_coffeebreakdownvideo.mp4';\nimport ARPosters from '../img/aeropress_posters.jpg';\nimport ARProcess from '../img/aeropress_process.gif';\nimport ARPersona1 from '../img/aeropress_persona1.png';\nimport ARPersona2 from '../img/aeropress_persona2.png';\nimport ARMarketingFunnel from '../img/aeropress_marketingfunnel.jpg';\nimport ARBrainstorm from '../img/aeropress_brainstorm.jpg';\nimport ARStumptown from '../img/aeropress_stumptown.jpg';\nimport ARProductStatement from '../img/aeropress_productstatement.jpg';\nimport ARStoryboard from '../img/aeropress_storyboard.jpg';\nimport ARLowFiPrototype from '../img/aeropress_lowfiprototype.jpg';\nimport ARUnityVideo from '../img/aeropress_unityvideo.mp4';\nimport ARFeaturesVideo from '../img/aeropress_featuresvideo.mp4';\nimport ARHowToGuide from '../img/aeropress_howtoguide.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass ARProjectPage extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n      \t<div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">An Augmented Reality Experience for AeroPress</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n        \t<div className=\"project-text-half\">\n\t\t    \t<div className=\"padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t        <h1 className=\"padding-top-1em\">How might we use AR to introduce AeroPress to new audiences within the café space?</h1>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t    <div className=\"padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t        <div className=\"project-caption padding-top-1em\">\n\t\t\t\t        <h3>Context</h3>\n\t\t\t\t        <h5 className=\"padding-top-1em\">Proof of concept prototype for a collaborative AR brand experience, designed and developed in 2019 during the Design and Technology: Augmented Realities program at Parsons.</h5>\n\t\t\t        </div>\n\t\t\t        <div className=\"project-caption padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t\t\t        <h3>Role</h3>\n\t\t\t\t        <h5 className=\"padding-top-1em\">UX research, UI design and development.

Not just the beverage (although I do drink it daily), but the entire culture. I love visiting cafés and trying different beans and roasts, and I’ve just recently got into concocting my own speciality brews at home. I even built a website just for fun explaining the ingredients in each drink, for those that don’t know their macchiato from their mocha.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARCoffeeBreakdownVideo} alt=\"A screen recording of my coffee breakdown site\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text\">\n\t        \t<a className=\"button\" href=\"https://madspesh.github.io/coffeebreakdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the live demo</a>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <br />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p>So when we were given an open brief to design an AR experience for a brand and/or product of our choosing, I chose my current fave coffee brewer, the AeroPress. I spoke to a number of fellow coffee drinkers about how they made coffee at home, and discovered most used machines, instant coffee or paper filters. Very few used a coffee press, mostly due to not really knowing how it worked. This was a great opportunity to highlight an innovative product that people may not even know they want until they see it in action.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The product advantage</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">AeroPress is not a typical coffee press, but it uses a similar mechanism. Coffee is steeped for 10–50 seconds (depending on the grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The result is an espresso strength concentration of coffee, which can then be combined with other ingredients to make a variety of drinks.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand’s target audience are coffee aficionados; people who really know about coffee. As the equipment and process can appear to be quite confusing to those unfamiliar with the product, there is a barrier to entry. But also an area for opportunity! Aeropress is a brand which embraces creativity, as evidenced below in numerous posters for their <a href=\"https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World AeroPress Championships</a>. The essence of AeroPress embodies experimentation and innovation, therefore augmented reality could be their perfect tool for brand awareness.</p>\t\t        \n\t        </div>\t        \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPosters} alt=\"World AeroPress Championship posters\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Defining the challenge</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started out by doing some competitive research into similar brands. The AeroPress is a unique patented device, but there are some related products with similar niche audiences such as Chemex, Rok and Moka pot. There are also traditional French presses made by the likes of Bodum, Grosche and Espro. None of the competitors I researched had ever ventured into XR.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I also did some first-hand behavioural research by documenting myself using the AeroPress, as I was initially thinking about designing an AR experience to explain how all the different equipment parts fit together and function. However, after having so much difficulty holding the phone whilst using the AeroPress, I realised that a handheld mobile guide (at least in the touch-powered sense) wouldn’t be helpful to new users at all.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARProcess} alt=\"Pictures of the AeroPress brewing process\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Visualising personas</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead of focusing on designing an AR experience solely for home use, I decided to approach the brief from a different angle and target coffee-drinkers in their native environment; the coffee shop. I continued my user research by visiting café’s and talking to the patrons around me as well as interviewing fellow students, and I began to identify some similar personality traits.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I designed two coffee-drinking personas that I wanted to target; the first being ‘The Café Hipster’. He lives in New York, is in his late 30’s, and works for a tech startup. He is a Café Hipster because he spends most of his spare time in independent coffee shops, and he turns his nose up at mainstream chains like Starbucks and mainstream products like Nespresso.</p>\t\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">He would like to make high-quality coffee at home, and he has heard of the AeroPress but doesn’t currently own one. He has a high level of tech proficiency due to his job, and tries to keep up with the latest products and trends. Augmented reality is something that he would be really interested in.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARPersona1} alt=\"The ‘Café Hipster’ persona\" />    \n\t        <img src={ARPersona2} alt=\"The ‘Wannabe Barista’ persona\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n\t\t        <p>My second persona is ‘The Wannabe Barista’. She is a 19 year old student from Croydon, and like most people her age, she also has a high level of tech proficiency. However, she likes to spend her time online using social media platforms like Instagram.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">She prefers to visit mainstream chains like Starbucks, as she likes ordering fun seasonal drinks such as Pumpkin Spiced Latte. Her interest in social media also drives her to post pictures of the drinks she purchases, and she loves sharing cool new products and apps with friends. She doesn’t know how to make her own coffee at home, and she can’t afford an expensive machine like Nespresso.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARMarketingFunnel} alt=\"The two personas positioned in the marketing funnel\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Discovering opportunities</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">If we look at the traditional product marketing funnel above, The Wannabe Barista would be placed in the awareness bracket, as she has vaguely heard of AeroPress but does not yet have a strong interest in wanting to find out more. The Café Hipster is aware of and has an interest in AeroPress due to socialising with baristas in his favourite coffee shops, and wanting to keep up with hipster brands, but he needs an incentive to want to actually buy the product.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I brainstormed some potential marketing opportunities, focusing on the ways that I could capture my two persona’s in the Awareness and Interest phase. As both visited café’s often, this was a natural space to introduce them to the experience and make them aware of the AeroPress brand.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In terms of generating interest, I thought that showing the potential of the AeroPress, such as its ability to create popular coffee drinks such as Lattes and Cappuccinos, would be the best way to drive users to buy. I also thought about using moments of delight such as animations and visualisations to make my experience more fun and shareable.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARBrainstorm} alt=\"Post its from the brainstorming session\" />   \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>The café space</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The brand space I chose to focus on was Stumptown Coffee Roasters. I chose Stumptown because they already have an affiliation with AeroPress. On their website, the brand has posted a <a href=\"https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how-to guide</a> showing users how to follow the ‘Stumptown style’ brew recipe they created specifically for AeroPress.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I visited both the Greenwich Village NYC location and the Midtown NYC location in the Ace Hotel. Although the flagship Greenwich Village branch sold AeroPress in-store, they did not serve AeroPress-made coffee. I had the idea that, perhaps by adding AeroPress coffee to their menu or creating a specific AeroPress menu, this might drive more sales. However, this would also need to be accompanied by some sort of in-store promotional experience.</p>\t\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I documented the experience of ordering coffee at Stumptown, in order to familiarise myself with the space and amenities available.I noticed that merchandising displays were placed strategically to entice people in the queue to order. The displays showcased Stumptown products such as branded mugs, cups and packages of coffee grounds.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStumptown} alt=\"Pictures from the Stumptown Greenwich Village location\" />  \n\t       \t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Concept statement</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">My research into both AeroPress and Stumptown Coffee helped form the concept statement for the project.</p>\n\t\t        <h4 className=\"padding-top-1em\">An augmented reality experience with longevity; introduced in store, reactivated at home. A collaborative promotion between AeroPress and Stumptown, the experience is supported by a new in-store AeroPress menu and branded merchandise.</h4>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Many AR apps created by brands are used once, in the moment of discovery, and then never opened again. I wanted to create an experience that provided promotion for the brands involved, whilst still being useful enough for people to want to use it again at home. Outlining the product statement below helped me to envision what the final product would look like, and what features and technologies would need to be included.</p>\n\t        </div> \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARProductStatement} alt=\"The product statement overview\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Storyboarding the user journey</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I began to envision how the experience would unfold by sketching out the steps that my user persona would take. I made sure to include every scenario, starting from the moment they enter the store, all the way through to the point of purchase, and then finally imagining how the product would continue to be used at home.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={ARStoryboard} alt=\"Storyboard sketches\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Low fidelity prototyping</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I started to create some low fidelity mockups, using a paper prototype of the interface to test in the cafe. I realised that using an image marker flat to the table, such as a napkin, was not ideal as depending on the height of the chair/stool the user may be required to stand up to scan it. Also, a napkin is not very durable - I needed an image marker that will last a long time in order for the user to be able to reactivate the experience at home.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Instead, I decided to use the actual coffee cup to activate the AR experience, using Vuforia’s cylinder image target. For this proof of concept prototype I am just using a recyclable paper cup, but I imagine the real thing to be a ceramic reuseable mug. Forming the pattern for the cup’s design was challenging, as the image target needed to be unique and highly contrasted enough to be easily detected by the Vuforia Engine.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={ARLowFiPrototype} alt=\"Testing the low fidelity prototype in store\" />     \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Creating the AR experience in Unity</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">3D assets such as the translucent cup were designed and imported from Cinema 4D, but the animated drinks were created directly in Unity using Animator Controllers. I wrote scripts which would trigger the animations when tapping objects within the scene.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Within the screen, Unity UI was the main toolset I used to design the buttons and canvas layout of the user interface. Icons and graphics were created in Adobe Illustrator, exported as PNGs and imported into the project to be used in the ingredients and how-to overlay panels.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARUnityVideo} alt=\"Testing the experience in Unity\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Proof of concept</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The final technical prototype can be categorised into three sections; firstly the main scene in which users can see the ingredients breakdown of different coffee drinks by tapping on the coasters, secondly the key screen panel which explains how each ingredient should be prepared, and lastly the full screen overlay which takes the user through the steps to creating the ‘Stumptown style’ AeroPress recipe.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The full screen overlay is the final stage of the experience; the reason for users to continue using the app once they’ve made their purchase and left the store. My prior research taught me that any digital devices used with AeroPress should ideally be hands free, so users can either tap through the steps or use voice commands to advance. I also integrated timer functions into a few of the steps to ensure that users are able to recreate the exact Stumptown brew.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <video className=\"padding-top-3em\" autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n    \t\t\t<source src={ARFeaturesVideo} alt=\"Screen recordings of the three main features\" type='video/mp4' />\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <h2>Future iterations</h2>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The proof of concept prototype was deployed onto an iPhone and demonstrated during a class critique with creative technologists from Havas. I received good feedback about the project, some of the most notable being that the experience could be better realised within the browser as a WebAR application.

For our getting-to-know-you <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19RViC9GsvPa6NRHOeDKfh08FWthqHF_mHQ_dQLFaL6Q/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">class presentation</a>, I created this slide illustrating a few of my interests.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Slide} alt=\"Slide showing my ideas for thesis\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m still not 100% sure about my direction, as there are a couple of other avenues which I would be interested in exploring. But for now, I am settling on glossophobia. Glossophobia is a type of speech anxiety, defined by a fear of public speaking. The term is derived from the Greek word glōssa, meaning tongue.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would describe myself as an introvert who likes being around people, but when it comes to work-related situations (interviews, presentations) or social environments where I feel pressured to speak, I clam up. This is something that has affected me for as long as I can remember. In these types of situations, I have a tendency to ‘go red’, my chest starts pounding, and sometimes I find it difficult to control my voice. Even just thinking about these encounters can trigger me.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Concentrating on glossophobia for my thesis could act as a form of therapy for me, as although I’ve looked into coping mechanisms in the past, I’ve never found something that actually works. I think this is an issue that a lot of my peers suffer with too, so there would be lots of opportunity for user research and testing.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <div className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">It’s also a subject which can be interpreted in a number of ways, whether it be a digital or physical coping mechanism, an art piece triggered by the issue, or even an immersive experience demonstrating how glossophobia feels.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I’m not sure which direction my project will take, but I have some initial ideas right now. I did some sketches illustrating a presentation device using augmented reality. The user can take advantage of two views; the front-facing ‘selfie’ mode and the rear camera mode.</p>\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using selfie mode, the user can review their speaker notes as well as the slides they need to present. The camera will analyse their facial movements and a microphone will record their voice. The user can receive feedback on the speed of their sentences, the number of times they say certain words (eg. ‘like’), how often they smiled, etc.</p>\n\t        </div>\n\t        <img className=\"project-text-half padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827Sketch} alt=\"A sketch of my AR presentation software idea\" />\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Using the rear camera mode, users can treat the device like an AR teleprompter. The screen will display speaker notes karaoke-style, and augmented reality can be used to recreate a social scene for the user to practice in. I created the paper prototype below to show how the selfie mode might work on a tablet.</p>\n\t        </div>\t   \n\t        <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20180827PaperPrototype} alt=\"A paper prototype of the selfie mode\" />  \n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n\t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I would like to get some feedback on whether this is an interesting route to continue with, and if so, what kind of features should or shouldn’t be included.</p>\n\t        </div>\t\t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog2018082;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190904MindMap from '../img/blog_20190904_mindmap.jpg';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190904 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Mind Mapping + Goal Setting</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-04</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">Last week in class, I made a mind map around my central theme of glossophobia.

Hopefully soon I’ll have some ideas about what to model!</p>\n\t        </div>\t\t        \n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t        <br />\n\t    </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nexport default Blog20190904;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Blog20190910Blender1 from '../img/blog_20190910_blender1.jpg';\nimport Blog20190910Blender2 from '../img/blog_20190910_blender2.jpg';\nimport Blog20190910Storyboard from '../img/blog_20190910_storyboard.jpg';\nimport Blog20190910Notes1 from '../img/blog_20190910_notes1.jpg';\nimport Blog20190910Notes2 from '../img/blog_20190910_notes2.jpg';\nimport Blog20190910Unity from '../img/blog_20190910_unity.mp4';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Blog20190910 extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      scrolled: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.scrollProgress);\n  }\n\n  scrollProgress = () => {\n    const scrollPx = document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n    const winHeightPx =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n    const scrolled = `${scrollPx / winHeightPx * 100}%`;\n\n    this.setState({\n      scrolled: scrolled\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const progressContainerStyle = {\n      background: \"transparent\",\n      height: \"2px\",\n      position: \"relative\",\n      top: 0,\n      left: 0,\n      width: \"100vw\",\n      zIndex: 99\n    };\n\n    const progressBarStyle = {\n      height: \"2px\",\n      background: \"#000000\",\n      width: this.state.scrolled\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"project-title\">\n\t        <div id=\"title\">Second Game Prototype</div>\n\t        <div className=\"progress-container\" style={progressContainerStyle}>\n\t          <div className=\"progress-bar\" style={progressBarStyle} />\n\t        </div>\n\t    </div>\n        <div id=\"project-page\">\n\t        <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        <br />\n  \t        \t<h3>2019-09-10</h3>\n  \t\t        <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">This past week, I've been thinking about things to prototype. Glossophobia seems like quite a specific topic to focus on, but in reality there are many ways to illustrate the subject; from service orientated products to more abstract expressive forms. My first prototype was definitely more service oriented, and my background in UX/UI is pushing me towards a more user-focused, 'helpful' project. However, this is my thesis and I have the time to experiment and try out new things (like games).</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Storyboard} alt=\"My game storyboard\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\"> I've never made a 3D game before, so for my second prototype I'm experimenting with that format to see how I like the process and hear what other people think of this weird freaky eyeball game. The idea is that you are a character who has to give a speech in an auditorium, but in order to get there you have to take a winding, treacherous path. You have a full script to read at the beginning, but the longer it takes to get to the auditorium, the more difficult it is to read. By the time you get inside, you have lost all your words and have nothing to say. Above is a quick storyboard of how the game would progress.</p>   \n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender1} alt=\"Creating a spiral shape in Blender\" />  \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Blender2} alt=\"Building the auditorium in Blender\" />  \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">I used Blender to create the auditorium, and I set up the scene using Unity. I added a first person controller for the player to navigate the scene using their keyboard, but I'm thinking about other forms of controllers - maybe voice commands could be cool? Below is a screen recording of how it looks so far. I still need to add the interactivity - the heat/steam rising, the eyeballs turning to look at you, maybe some scary music. This is a work in progress.</p>\n\t        </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190910Unity} alt=\"A video recording of the game scene so far\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In other news, I'm happy that I managed to cross off one of my semester goals of visiting the XReality Lab (I will write more about this when I visit again). I also started to write down a list of my project's potential audience types, possible situations and environments where glossophobia could occur, the physical/mental symptoms of glossophobia, and viable technological solutions which could help ease or bring awareness to the issue. This list is really helpful when thinking about questions to ask during interviews, which will be the next part of my research phase.</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Notes1} alt=\"Notes on audience/users and situations/environments\" /> \n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190910Notes2} alt=\"Notes on physical/mental symptoms and technological solutions\" /> \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-3em\">\n            <h2>What do I need to do this week?</h2>\n            <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">- I need to interview at least one person from one of my defined user/audience sets.

I want to speak to past students who have done projects in the domain of public speaking, as well as people working in academia who are involved in speech and voice training. I actually found two professors within The New School, from Lang and the Mannes School of Music, so hopefully I'll be able to speak to them in person at some point. I also found some people working in XR for therapy, who would be able to give me some good tips on AR/VR techniques for anxiety.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\"> \n                I also got some advice about looking into other areas outside of public speaking such as HR and recruitment, and it got me thinking about a charity event that I used to volunteer at back in London called Crisis at Christmas. Every year around the holiday season, the Crisis centres hold a range of activities geared towards helping homeless people with shelter and comfort at Christmas. The first year I went I was an arts and crafts volunteer, but the second time I volunteered in the IT department which involved helping guests with writing resumes, sending emails, and other computer activities. Now that I'm thinking more about a specific audience, I'm wondering whether a product to help someone prepare for a job interview for example would be helpful. One thing I know is that it would need to be simple to use and relatively low tech, as the equipment at centres like this is usually very old.</p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">          \n                I got some good feedback from my presentation on Friday, and now I'm thinking about ways I can integrate the playful aspects of a game with a more serious method of treatment for public speaking anxiety. I went to the XReality Center at The New School last week, and this week I visited RLab in Brooklyn for my XR in the Real World class - it's given me lots of inspiration about things to experiment with. At the XReality Center I met Maya Georgieva (director of Digital Learning) and got the chance to try out the Magic Leap, which was amazing!</p>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"padding-top-3em\" src={Blog20190913MagicLeap} alt=\"Magic Leap equipment and glasses view of the Create UI\" /> \n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">\n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">The program I used was called Create - I've added a screenshot above of how the UI menu looked from inside the glasses. The Magic Leap detected the floor and walls of the center, and I was able to place blocks with gravity which toppled over if nudged. I could also place scenes, stickers and moving objects such as fish and dinosaurs. There was the option to build pipes and connecting objects; I didn’t try that enough though. I could draw around the room using various types of pens with different textures. The controller is a handheld laser pointer which I used to interact with the UI. There were three inputs - a main trigger button to control the laser, another button to bring up submenus and make other selections, and a small button on top to exit/cancel things. I could walk around the drawings I made, seeing them from the front, side and back view.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"padding-top-2em\">I noticed that they had some VR programs available to try for the Oculus Gear/Go. One of them looked like it was a kind of interview prep program, so I definitely want to go back soon and check that out.  I know Samsung also have a suite of VR apps for Oculus that are geared towards public speaking, called <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&path=app/1096173157163965&ref=oculus_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#BeFearless</a>.

The concept for my AR feature is quite basic, but the technical side of it was more difficult to execute. It's still not fully working on my iPhone, but it seems to be useable on my laptop. I am testing the functionality of using my voice to control a text object in augmented reality. Sometimes the speech recogniser has trouble identifying my words. There also seems to be a bug which is causing the text to animate onto the screen twice. I’m wondering if other AI models might have better results with the speech recognition issue - I’d like to try Google Cloud Speech-to-Text next.

As you can see below, the prototype identifies when certain keywords are spoken (ie. ‘animation’, ‘design’ and ‘illustration’), and brings up a text overlay with some bullet points about that keyword (eg. ‘animation’ brings up bullet points such as ‘storyboarding’ and ‘After Effects’). Ideally, the flow before this screen would ask the user to either upload a job description or manually enter certain keywords that they want to talk about. The user would then write some bullet points to riff upon when that keyword is mentioned (either by the users or a potential interviewer on the phone).</p>\n          </div>\n          <video className=\"padding-top-3em\"autoPlay loop muted playsinline>\n            <source src={Blog20190924VoiceExperiment} alt=\"A video recording of my technical prototype\" type='video/mp4' />\n          </video>\n          <div className=\"project-text padding-top-2em\">          \n              <p className=\"padding-top-1em\">In additional to the prototype, I worked on creating <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1disKj1ETAeeBrUfqPk5BGRoDZ9TuNNqi1aYMC_UliCQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a list of 35 people I’d like to interview</a> based upon my community of practise that I identified last week.

Although he doesn’t have glossophobia, he gave me some interesting things to think about. He mentioned that, as an MBA student, talking to a lot of people isn’t a big deal for him; it’s smaller groups that scare him. He hates having to do small talk. Also, being an international student from India, he found networking events very difficult as he often didn’t have any context on topics that people often casually talk about (eg. TV shows like Seinfeld, ‘trendy’ areas in New York like Williamsburg). I found this interesting as I had always thought of good public speakers being confident in all areas of socialising.
